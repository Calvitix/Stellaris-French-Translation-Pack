Upon sending a small miniaturized probe through this hole, they realized that it led to...nothing.\n\nIndeed, this hole punches straight through the rest of the Birch World's shell, and leads directly to the vacuum right above the supermassive black hole! From there, what little water comes through immediately falls into the singularity and turns into new and exciting forms of matter before ultimately disappearing into the event horizon.\n\nWhile originally confused about the purpose of this hole, they then realized that it was hastily and artificially drilled through the Birch World's shell long after the creation of the reservoir itself. By analyzing the roughness of the hole itself, they deduced that another civilization on the Birch World, or perhaps some dastardly explorers, saw this reservoir as an opportunity to unveil what lied beneath the Birch World's colossal crust without having to dig through hundred of kilometers of nanoalloys beforehand.\n\nWhoever did this subsequently drilled a small hole through the seafloor with relatively primitive tools compared to what Aeternum had, and either them or their equipment most likely ended up falling to their doom into the singularity.\n\nThe actual purpose of the reservoir is unclear, but our expedition believes it might have simply been a place where Aeternum stored large amounts of water for future projects, which they evidently never realized.\n\nOur team estimates that it will take roughly 374 million years for the reservoir to completely drain into the black hole, and while this hasn't revealed anything of particular interest, studying the water falling into the black hole nonetheless yielded small amounts of physics research."
