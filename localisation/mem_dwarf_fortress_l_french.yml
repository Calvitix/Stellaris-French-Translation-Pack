Notre équipe d'expédition finit par tomber dans une plus grande caverne contenant ce qui est apparemment l'entrée d'une sorte de structure semblable à un bunker. Au milieu de la caverne, une seule grande colonne retient le poids de tout le plafond.

Leaving all precaution behind, [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] moved the lever.\n\nA clicking noise followed by a loud crumbling filled the hall. Nearly instantaneously, the column and the ceiling above came crashing down to the ground before slowly rising back to their former position, revealing those unfortunate enough to have been caught by their weight. Though having escaped death by a heartbeat, this has had a lasting impression on Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName]."

It appears that triggering the lever would have caused most of the ceiling to fall to the ground. Afterwards, the mechanism would lift the fallen pieces back up into their initial position, resetting the mechanism. Who would create such a trap?"

Mummified corpses of short yet stout alien humanoids littered the ground. It isn't clear what exactly transpired here, but all of them appear to have met a violent end.\n\nThe first accessible complex near the bunker's entrance had supposedly served as a barracks and armory for security personnel. These aliens seem to have possessed technology comparable to our own, utilizing power armors and energy-based weaponry. Curiously, however, large portions of the storage area were occupied by a number of obsolete melee weapons, such as hammers and axes.\n\nAs investigations proceeded further within the complex, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] wandered into what [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] believed to be some kind of training hall. When a team member blithely pulled an unmarked lever, multiple spikes rapidly emerged from the floor, then retracted as quickly as they had appeared. Iconography that appeared when the lever was pulled suggests these spikes were intended to train users in dodging techniques."

 #Dwarf fortress digsite stage 4 - Commercial district
 mem_dwarf_fortress.7.name:0 "Dark Humor"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.7.desc:0 "Leaving the entrance section behind, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] and [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] team have entered what they believe to be a commercial district. From reliefs on walls, floors and everyday objects, a substantial portion of the former inhabitants' history was reconstructed by the expedition team. This facility was established in these harsh conditions under the belief that deep underneath the facility existed veins of a rare - and to them, incredibly valuable - mineral ore. By pumping magma to the surface, they were able to access a nearly inexhaustible energy source, build a defence system relying on multiple lava-floodable areas, and discovered a means of disposing their "undesirables" - as shown extensively and repeatedly in the reliefs.\n\nA finding of particular value however was a library that provided our linguists with enough samples to translate the aliens' language. Not only will this make interactions with their technology easier, it has also given us a glimpse into their humor. The archived images of the stone plates found at the various trap locations read as follows: "Watch your steps..." and "Don't touch this!" for the lava and lever trap respectively. Another example was a tombstone in one of their burial grounds showing a warrior being impaled by multiple spikes at once in its relief, with the caption "Why didn't you dodge?!" Unsurprising to say that this brought back some not-so-distant memories...\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] expects to find more information on what happened here by searching the central section, which is currently locked behind a massive gate the expedition team has yet to open."

 #Dwarf fortress digsite stage 5 - Central district
 mem_dwarf_fortress.8.name:0 "Of Fire and Blood"
 mem_dwarf_fortress.8.desc:0 "Opening the gate was quite the endeavor. Once the excavation team finally made it through, it became clear that this wasn't by accident. Someone had put in a lot of effort to seal it from the inside, even to the extreme of being unable to ever open it again. Not that anyone would have tried. It appears that the inhabitants were more concerned with killing each other, though the reason for this only became clear after one of the scientists stumbled over a chronicle in the bunker's data storage.\n\nAt first, the outpost had grown steadily, and its prosperity attracted many newcomers. Many inhabitants not only worked in the mines but also engaged in the fine arts, creating objects intricately decorated with fractal images of themselves and other beautiful yet strange-looking creations. When their mining effort yielded its first successes, the colony experienced an economic boom.\n\nDespite being constantly besieged by nebulous rivals, it endured for multiple generations. However, as the dig to the planetary core drew near its conclusion, entries in the chronicle had long since turned sour, reporting of growing greed and widespread paranoia amongst the population. \n\nWith irrational behaviour and violent outbursts on the rise, everything found its culmination in a catastrophic chain of events when the 'Lord of the Guard' challenged the bunker's overseer to a duel over the possession of a highly valuable artifact mentioned only by its name: §Y'Cubortob Unil Omoth'§!. The duel quickly turned into a struggle of life and death, ending only with the challenger's victory. Subsequent entries report about consecutive duels similar to the first occurring on a daily basis. The end of the chronicle is a single line repeated over and over again: "It will be mine!"\n\nThe situation seems to have escalated quickly from that point on, prompting the excavation team to wonder what kind of object could cause an entire society to collapse. Unfortunately, no further information about the artifact has been found.\n\nIn an effort to find out more about the valuable material that was mined at this colony, the scientists proceeded to head for the core-boring section, only to be met by another barricaded doorway..."

 mem_dwarf_fortress.9.desc:0 "When the doorway had been cleared, the excavation team was unsurprised to discover more corpses lying about in this section. However, one of them stood out.\n\nHidden in the most secluded corner, a lone corpse was found leaning on a wall, in its deathly grip a strange-looking, oversized metal boot. Next to the corpse was a datapad, its contents shedding some light on the nature of the strange item. Though the only thing written in the last log entry was "Mine, it is finally mine!!!", Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] quickly concluded that the metal sabaton had to be §Y'Cubortob Unil Omoth'§!, the reason for the breakdown of this colony.\n\nOn closer inspection, it was revealed that parts of the artifact were made of the ultra-rare material the outpost had originally been established to mine. In the facility's chronicles, it was named 'living metal' for its ability to 'remember' its original form if damaged or manipulated - essentially a self-repairing material. Once the underground veins had been opened up and living metal introduced to the population, it quickly found widespread use amongst the rest of the colony. What the former inhabitants had apparently failed to realize were the adverse long-term effects on their mental health caused by prolonged contact with the material. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] wisely advised everyone to avoid direct physical contact with the substance and use protective clothing when interacting with it.\n\nThe deposit of this rare metal seems to be far from fully exploited, and if sufficient safety measures are taken, we should be able to resume mining operations here."
