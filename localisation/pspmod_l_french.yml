As there are no signs of destruction or bodies in the remains of the cities, our scientists believe that the inhabitants abandoned this planet and moved to another one. Our investigations have revealed depictions of at least 20 different types of alien species, ranging from mammals to arthropods. Among those species, a reptilian species with four arms stand out with more depictions, which possibly means they were the leading species of the alliance.\n\n Among our findings was the spaceport of the planet.

Social scientist presume the conflict might have rooted in the alliance's multi-ethnicity, as it is quite common for multi-ethnic empires to experience such conflicts among different species.\n\n According the data our scientists could gather, the central government of the alliance had decided to abandon the planet, but had failed to evacuate all of its citizens.

Logs found in the headquarters show that the central government's desperately efforts to stop the situation from spreading across the alliance had failed. Radical measures such as orbital bombings and military deployments had been taken to no avail on [From.Planet.GetName], which had been the traffic hub of the alliance.\n\n Although most of the data found in the headquarters have been rendered useless, coordinates to another colony has been recovered.

This particular area seems to be the one of the most important ones before the epidemic, as can be seen from the more stricter security measures and its size being bigger than the others.\n\n A highly encrypted project has been found at the heart of the complex.

The project was cleverly connected to the empire's ideology, and went on for more than 500 years. The empire carried out experiments on the animals, plants, even their own citizens, and other species as well, collecting genetic specimen and refining and combining them. Their advancement in genetic engineering and biology were mere by-products of the project.\n\n According to the records, the project had been finished 10 years before their downfall, but the results are nowhere to be seen on the planet.

Their immune system began to attack their brains, thinking they were alien matter. Due to the serious damage inflicted on their brains, these ultimate lifeforms turned into raging lunatics with super strengths, and violence and slaughter soon spread all over the empire.\n\n They could not believe their perfect design caused such a catastrophe, and desperately searched for the 'real' reason of the epidemic and its cure.

Most of them are presumed to be the ones that had been shot down in space combat, but surprisingly some have been analyzed to have come out of the ground.\n\n The remains of the ships that had come out of the ground share a unique pattern of destruction. Half of the hull remains intact without signs of explosion or penetration, but the other half is completely shattered into pebble size bits. As our explorers on the field describe, the sturdiest armored ships had been broken in pieces like glass would.\n\n The sight of the relatively intact body of the ship covered by pebble-sized broken pieces resembles the pebble-filled slope of a rocky mountain. It would need explorers to get up this sooty mountain."

 pspmod_coprean_constitution.1.name:0 "Coprea"
 pspmod_coprean_constitution.1.desc:0 " From the data gathered from our initial exploration, our scientist discovered that most of the ships were staffed with human-type animals with an average height of 2 meters. They were the navy of the Coprean Constitution, a republic that existed 1.6 million years ago.\n\n Although ships from other species were also found, most of the Coprean ships had been destroyed by Coprean weapons, which led our team to think that there was a civil war between the Copreans, and alien civilizations joined in the fight.\n\n According to the operation references found on the alien ships, the Coprean Constitution have been in decline for tens of thousands of years after its golden age. It took isolationism as its diplomatic ideology during the decline, and newer empires came to call it the fallen empire. It probably didn't have the strength to revive itself after the civil war, which on sped it up on its way down.\n\n Personal record terminal units are scattered inside the Coprean ships as if they want to be seen. It seems that recording was a deep-rooted obsession for the Copreans as can be seen from the fact the soon-to-be-dead personnel tried to record what happened amidst the panic and confusion inside the falling ship.\n\n The terminals deleted the recordings after a while without being used, which seem to be a military security measure. However, our team could try to gather and combine the scattered data to come up with an explanation."

Political turmoil was at its highest in the Coprean Republic, with their ruling and opposition parties, namely the 'Goldens' and the 'Philosophers' fighting fiercely. However, the amendment of the constitution which originally had been the main issue of the conflict was passed roughly and hastily, and both parties ordered each other to disband. Eventually the situation escalated into a coup and then into a civil war.\n\n Having been on the losing side for a while, the opposition party broke away from their isolationist ideology and established an exile government in the confederation of inner galaxy empires and asked for their help. The federation, which had been looking for an opportunity to gain influence in the Coprean Republic, agreed immediately and joined in the fight as the opposition party's ally. However, the ruling party did not stand idly, but created a new federation uniting the outer galaxy empires. The civil war was now the world war. The battle site is only but a tiny sample of the war. Although the information gathered is not enough for our scientists to identify the winning side, they have concluded that the Copreans civilization met its demise because of the war.\n\n The story of the Coprean is bigger than our initial anticipation. More studies will be conducted on the Copreans on many more excavation sites, even after the secrets of the ship remains get solved.\n\n Our explorers have discovered a ship pretty deep down under. It seems that it stopped while it was being shot out from the ground."
 pspmod_coprean_constitution.3.name:0 "Submarine"
 pspmod_coprean_constitution.3.desc:0 " The security on the navigation records are not operational, which probably is a side effect of the ship's sudden destruction.\n\n The ships were sub-space submarines, on which advanced technology that enables the ship to hide in sub-space areas even in gravisphere had been applied. They were only able to 'submerge' for a short period a time, but it was quite enough to launch surprise attacks. If they had been used actively, the paradigm of war would certainly have changed.\n\n But the Copreans had long-lost the knowledge on how to design a submarine, and no one knew how to drive it correctly. As a result, the submarine with wrong navigation warped inside the gravisphere nearby, in other words, in the middle of the planet's crust. Half of the ship's body shattered like pieces of glass, stuck between dimensions. The Copreans barely managed to recover the knowledge on how to build submarines by the end of the war.\n\n A religious writing has been found on the terminal in the captain's quarters, that he wanted his eye plucked and buried on a planet, if the other managed to find his body. Along with it was a prayer that congressman Innovo would revive the Coprean glory.\n\n Several civilian cargo ships that were hidden behind other ship remains have been found. It seems the planet originally had been used as a resting place for traders. A set of coordinates for the planet that the writing found in the captain's cabin mentioned was found among the documents inside a cargo ship. Dispatching a archaeological team to the planet is recommended.\n\n Bring back the submarine parts and the valuables from the cargo ships."

Since the planet is distorting signals to disguise itself as a gas giant, our drone will report that it had been destroyed by the gassy atmospheric storm.\n\n The data didn't provide us with the knowledge on how to turn off the massive holographic image, but it is highly probable that the power switch might be somewhere easy to find."

A disassembly of the controller on the satellite unveiled the continental planet, dispelling the illusion of a gas giant.\n\n From far away, the planet looks pretty normal, but up close, it's atmosphere is unusually thin and there're no animals at all. Perhaps the Copreans installed a device which only allows survival only for plants and fungi?\n\n However, the planet is extraordinarily fertile, which gives off the notion of it being a farming planet. Some scientists argue that it was a terraformed planet for vegetarians. Quite a rash explanation that the danger of civil war caused the terraforming process to end prematurely and the magnetic field of the planet too weak to hold the atmosphere.\n\n It is impossible for an ecosystem to prosper without animals to balance itself, but our scientific knowledge is too narrow compared to the precursors. Should keep our eyes toward all possibilities."

All the plants on the planet are mockup. Exotic trees, beautiful autumn colored mountain, flowers swaying with the wind, countless nameless weeds- everything single one is actually a skillfully crafted plastic mockup with preservatory coating.\n\n The rivers and the oceans are made up of acidulous distilled water with no minerals. The soil and the rocks of colored neo-concrete. no life forms of any kind is found here. It's an uninhabitable illusion.\n\n Our close-range scanners have detected over two hundred artificial caverns hidden behind artificial bush.

Our initial theories had to be abandoned as more powerful the magnetic field got as deeper it went. Our explorers had to go in on foot because of the severe magnetic interferences and narrow passages. Some of them were unfortunate and got lost.\n\n At the end of the visitor-repelling maze was a vast, unmeasurably huge empty cave. As our team shone flashlights they could see countless building ruins in the dark. Massive pillars were supporting the cavern's roof, beside the endless ruins of the underground city.\n\n It is unclear if this is the correct description, but the undergrown city is spread out over all the planet's crust. The place where our explorers landed was in fact a massive shell built above the planetary city.\n\n A relic world hidden under the guise of a continental world, also hidden under the image of a gas giant.\n\n Did the Copreans want to hide the city from other species? But to do so, hiding the city under the guise of a barren planet would have been way easier.\n\n It will take more time to finish the expedition."

The Avus observed 21 different primitive civilizations, while maintaining the principle of non-involvement. However, as their population kept declining, they decided to enlighten one of the primitive stone-age civilization and incorporated them into their empire. They were the Copreans, that even in stone-age, got attention from the Avus with their superb intelligence.\n\n At the end of Avus' history, more than 90% of their population was Coprean, as the Avus' population kept on declining and the Copreans kept multiplying, both for hundreds of years. Data gathered from a memorial stone describes the last days of the Avus. Their capital planet was surrounded by an alien empire, after getting attacked by surprise. The hurriedly constructed Coprean fleet had won them the decisive battle, and a peace treaty was signed. The Avus, however, already went extinct with the fall of their capital.\n\n The Avus' civilization and technology transferred to the Copreans, which led them into the greatest days of their history. Since the establishment of the Coprean Republic, their scientific knowledge and level of financial wealth soon exceeded the Avus' by far. The vast fake forest surrounding the ruins are a coffin and an offering of flowers for the Avus, built during the golden age of the Copreans. The maze and the gas giant disguise was a protection against undeserving thieves.\n\n The Copreans used the isomer-plastic to keep them maintained after tens of thousand years, even after they had lost most of their technologies.\n\n Meanwhile, an interesting phrase of words has been found in the terminal which was sitting before the memorial stone. It said the opposition party eventually agreed upon an euthanasia, and the Copreans no longer deserved to cherish this place, along with coordinates pointing to a hideout for the Copreans who might visit in the future."

They were deemed political criminals by the ruling party and left home. As their homeland suffered more and more as time went by, the exiles became sick of the now corrupt republic, and tried to rebuild the Avus empire with congressman Innovo as the new emperor, who had been still working hard to prevent the fall of the republic.\n\n The most recent resolution described three epidemics the ruling party had contaminated the republic with, and their will to eliminate those. The first of the three was religion, but the second and third item is illegible.\n\n According to our research on the rotten plants, the time of the plants' outburst coincides with the period where no more recordings were made.

Since no recordings after the creep's breakout exists, that's about all we could find about the hideout. However we can draw from what we've seen, that the creep's ability to survive and invasive capabilities were unexpectedly strong, and eventually caused the hideout's downfall.\n\n Our explorers have identified the location of the Coprean home planet.

Our city engineers are refusing to categorize this planet according to traditional standards.\n\n Archaeology has not been applied in constructing the buildings of Magnasanti, and its environment is devastated beyond the point of no return during the process in which the buildings replaced the forest. Our city engineers argue that this 'suicidal city' should not be classified as a planetary city, which is referred to as the epitome of archaeology.\n\n This kind of thoughtless development is a characteristic common in mechanical planets, but Magnasanti isn't one of those. Apart from the environment, the buildings themselves are sophisticated complex of advanced construction technology, and luxurious amusement facilities and parks that organic creatures like are everywhere.\n\n However, the planet lost all of its water, atmosphere, and geological energies and became a completely barren planet, on which no one should be able to cultivate.\n\n It seems that a new city had been built after the civil war devastated the planet, as can be drawn from the remains of destroyed buildings and intact ones being together. Or perhaps another civilization built the new city upon the ruins of Magnasanti."

 pspmod_coprean_constitution.10.desc:0 " Among the once-splendid sea of skyscrapers, rather dull-looking buildings shaped like pillars stands at regular intervals. Those green buildings of similar heights and widths were medical centers for senior citizens, called the Tower of Life.\n\n The Copreans trusted their government that they would be taken care of even when they are too old to work. The towers of life were the symbols of Coprean egalitarianism and wealth, that the empire could maintain such a high level of social security system for all of its citizens. During its golden age, the towers meant eternal lives, and eternal prosperity.\n\n Thus they lived eternally. The towers did not allow anyone to die. Although the extremely old had to spend most of their time asleep inside the life support devices, they were able to meet their family and participate in events on special occasions, thanks to the use of stimulants.\n\n The eternal prosperity ended, when the only day the old were awake was the election day. The number of people inside the towers now exceeded the people on the outside, and the politicians only needed to win the votes of the tower residents. Once prospered empire of the Copreans became a laughing-stock. Luckily, the number of votes coming from the towers were declining slowly.\n\n However, the decline didn't last long, and the tower votes began to increase. no one had seen the tower residents actually vote, but well, hey, it's secret voting. People outside wanted reformations, but the principle of equality now became a burden, and rigged election became a mere subject the politicians bring out to avoid talking about actual problems. Even the few reformist politicians repeated the empty words that the rigged elections are the main problems."

Pro and anti-amendment demonstrators fiercely clash multiple times, and the religions circles bombarded Innovo with insults that he was trying legalize euthanasia. The press, in support of the ruling party, argued that the opposition party was controlling the religious world by taking advantage of the people's admiration for the Avus, and the anxiety about declining economy.\n\n Right before the voting began, Innovo revived a set of laws which had been practically dead for tens of thousand years. Firstly, local governments must supervise religious activities involving critical patients, and secondly, the central government can browse through the supervisors personal documents if local governments neglect maintenance of sanitary facilities. By using those laws, he was able to uncover the linkage between the opposition party and the new religious cult, then ordered the opposition party to disband after a summary trial. Resistance and suppression soon followed, and the voting was delayed for a week."

The opposition party eventually accepted euthanasia.\n\n The opposition party however, decided to euthanize the citizens outside the tower. They released lethal chemicals into the water pipes as a last resort. Majority of the citizens who were in the support of the constitutional amendment died that day.\n\n According to a civilian history book, the amendment was approved by a tiny difference in votes. But the Tower of Life was no longer the central issue. Congressman Innovo had declared martial law, which was soon followed by the opposition party's terrorist attack on the presidential palace, which then led to a civil war. Surviving citizens were either crying out for the glory of the nation and the victory of Innovo, or for the judgement of innovo and the second coming of apocalypse. The war between the dictator and the fanatics spread throughout the galaxy as the opposition party established an exiled government in the inner galaxy.\n\n Our explorers were able to secure a copy of the resolution at the closed undersea base, where the exiles were occupying. It described the three diseases as religion, euthanasia, and suspicion. The public's suspicion began when the opposition unveiled Innobo's doppelganger. The opposition party claimed to have found the real Innovo locked up in a space prison cell, and the ruling party is in fact using a hologram of Innovo to instigate whole of Coprea.\n\n The ruling party, which had only been maintained solely by Innovo's charisma, was split over the incident and the opposition party gained power with their fleet's decisive victory against the ruling party.

Coprea lacked resources to build a fleet, but the inner galactic federation, was in no better shape due to a war of attrition with the outer galactic federation. The federation had no choice but to recognize Coprea's independence as they could not deal with the guerrilla warfare the Copreans were putting on.\n\n Both the Coprean Constitution and its home planet were devastated, fallen far down from their golden age. The Towers of Life and the patients were both out of power. Innovo was nowhere, there were only rumors that he had been assassinated at the end of the civil war.\n\n However, Coprea was able to revive itself off of its advanced technology. The rebuilding of the home planet proceeded smoothly with resource extraction and the economy back on track, along with the leftovers from the golden era. Unfortunately at the same time, a new psychological disease has silently taken root in the revived empire.\n\n Copreans saw their home planet thrive in their dreams every night and began to suffer from collective hallucinations. Strangely, they felt stable on skyscrapers, but felt extreme stress when they were in places with no buildings. The Copreans used all of their remaining strengths to cover their entire home planet with cities, and no one was there to stop them even when the environmental damage and pollution caused serious damage. The Copreans filled their planet entirely with cities, destroying themselves in the most ridiculous manner in the galaxy. Even when the end eventually came, they were still relieved to see their home in such a state.\n\n Even after the Copreans went extinct, the cities have developed on their own and consumed all the planet's resources, turning it into completely barren."

Believing that such was the true path of evolution, the collective consciousness abandoned the body the Avus and became the Coprea.\n\n The collective consciousness, which took a long time to understand sentient beings, was no longer a collective consciousness, but a society itself. The Copreans believed that they were truly free, but the Coprean society was in fact a literal living creature. The Copreans knew that there were unexplainable strange parts in their history, but when they tried to investigate further, the whole society refused.\n\n They were force by the fear deep inside to record their feelings and will obsessively in order to identify themselves.

Notre équipe a pu obtenir les derniers enregistrements, et a appris la fin de l'empire Astanine. Si l'Empire a fini par vaincre les rebelles, mais finalement, les technologies holographiques ont été rejettées par l'ensemble de la population, et progressivement été abandonnées, voire interdites pendant plusieurs années.\n\nAprès des années de guerre civile et l'absence des technologies holographiques, l'Astanine a rapidement perdu leur avantage -la dépendance à l'égard de ces technologies au cours des dernières années les avait laissées sans aucune autre défense. Pendant ce temps, les Tistra, qui avaient profité du temps passé par l'Astanine à combattre les rebelles, pour reconstruire leurs forces, ont de nouveau déclaré la guerre à l'Astanine, ce qui a mis fin à l'empire avec leurs technologies holographiques."
