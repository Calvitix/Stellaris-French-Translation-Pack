    ehof_cause:0 "§HCause§!\nDue to the uncertainty principle, in every fraction of a second, quantum fluctuations of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs occur countless times everywhere in space. These fluctuations stimulate tiny volumes of space and create the microcosmic structure of space known as quantum foam. Virtual micro black holes which only exist for an immensely short period of time can emerge in this quantum foam. These black holes can turn into real $ehof_wormhole$ via quantum tunneling and the lifetime is much longer than that of the micro black holes, but still extremely short and can potentially be inflated for space travel. However the number of occurrences is too small in average space."

    ehof_effect:0 "§HEffect§!\nThe highest density of quantum fluctuations can be found at the event horizon of a black hole where the already enormously twisted space is filled with more virtual particles, due to the hawking radiation that is responsible for the decay of black holes. The quantum foam structure of space is so intensely stimulated in these volumes, that the number of emerging micro black holes is many magnitudes larger than in average space and thus the number of $ehof_wormholes$ which can be inflated."

The fields serve as enormous immaterial tweezers for the inflation process and also keep the $ehof_wormholes$ open.\n\nIn order to increase the stability of the $ehof_wormholes$, the $ehof_ehofp2$ is equipped with negative pressure application plates, which apply negative pressure to the event horizon while a $ehof_wormhole$ is being inflated. This cools down the local space around the black hole, reducing the number of quantum fluctuations and as a consequence the quantum tunneling effects.

Gravitational projectors and dampers are added to the $ehof_wormholes$ inflation mechanism and combined with the squeezed, condensed electromagnetic field projectors. This allows the creation of gravitational-electromagnetic quasi-fields, which create a repulsive force that can be used to inflate the $ehof_wormholes$.\n\n$ehof_darkmatter$ combined with negative pressure, create $ehof_qnm$, which can further stabilize inflated $ehof_wormholes$. For this reason, Dark Matter injectors have been integrated into the $ehof_ehofp3$ to inject Dark Matter into the event horizon.\n\nMore negative pressure can be applied which cools down the local space around the black hole even further and produces $ehof_qnm$.\n\nThe $ehof_ehofp3$ is the most efficient a facility could be and increasing the efficiency of the $ehof_ehof$ would be almost impossible, as such probabilistic target routines for the $ehof_ehofp3$ targeting mechanisms include:\n  - Randomized Destinations\n  - $ehof_category_02$  - $ehof_category_03$\n  - $ehof_category_05$\n  - $ehof_category_06$  - $ehof_category_07$  - $ehof_category_08$  - $ehof_category_09$  - $ehof_category_10$"

This allows us to increase or decrease the vacuum energy density in a limited volume, which determines not only the way matter and energy behaves, but also the quantum fluctuations and quantum tunneling.\n\nThe probability for the $ehof_wormholes$ to tunnel to a different location has been eliminated entirely with this advancement.

    giga_dialog.3001.name:0 "The Mythical Square"
    giga_dialog.3001.desc:0 "In the [from.GetName] system lies a strange construct. Our scientists are baffled at the sight of this massive orbital installation circling the system's star. In fact, it is so ridiculous that it was assumed to be a prank, or an anomaly in our sensors.\n\nA $name_ringworld_square$.\n\nWithin the [from.GetName] system lies a square-shaped ringworld. While it appears to have sustained quite a lot of punishment in the past, it still seems to be mostly structurally intact. This construct's odd shape defies everything we know about physics and engineering, as gravity should have snapped this thing apart millennia ago. Yet, here it idly stands, waiting for something to uncover its mysteries.\n\nA small and mostly derelict station also floats silently above the star, and our scientists believe it might contain useful information about this peculiar structure.\n\nA §SSpecial Project§! has been issued to investigate this thing and the station in an effort to figure out how it even still exists."

Its frame is mostly made out of Quberine, an extremely advanced alloy packed with incredibly complex self-repairing electronics, thus explaining how it is able to withstand the incredible forces exerted on it.\n\nOur scientists believe it might be possible to repair this thing, given enough resources and sufficiently advanced technologies. We have detected a number of deactivated Quberine-manufacturing plants within the ringworld, which might start producing Quberine again if we restore this ringworlds power supply during future repairs.\n\nThe research teams have also concluded that the small station above the star serves as a sort of 'central access point' to the Squareworld's internal systems. They encourage us to spend some energy credits and alloys to repair and subsequently re-activate it, as it might grant us to access invaluable data about the Squareworld and its builders stored within its vast internal archives. Said data might very well be the key to repairing this wonderful construct..."

It's been a while since I've talked to a sapient entity.\n\nI am Garyx, the artificial intelligence responsible for maintaining the Squareworld and its vast data archives, and I have taken the form of a holographic reptilian, as this is what my makers looked like.\n\nAnyways, apologies for the sorry state of the Squareworld. I found a particularly interesting documentary about reptilian reproduction, and I've been studying it for the past 120 millennia using backup power in order to better understand my makers. Unfortunately, it seems that something drastic happened to the Squareworld in the meantime...Oh well.\n\nNow that you're here, and since my makers are apparently long gone, you can have permission to access the Squareworld's databanks, which are surprisingly mostly intact."

    giga_dialog.3005.a:0 "What's in those databanks?"
    giga_dialog.3005.a.response:0 "Oh, many things. My makers stored plenty of data about the various empires and species they knew about, their scientific knowledge, and most importantly, their deity §BQubey§!.\nThey wanted to preserve it so future generations could benefit from it, and, well, since you're here now, I guess they succeeded in this task. Too bad they're not here to see it anymore..."

    giga_dialog.3005.b:0 "How old is the Squareworld?"
    giga_dialog.3005.b.response:0 "Well, judging from the position of the stars, I estimate that this thing's been broken for about 120 000 of your years, but it is much older than that.\nIt was built about 567 000 years ago by my makers, and housed their civilization for many millennia. I'm not sure what happened to it, as I was unfortunately completely captivated by my research. The most likely possibility is that their civilization collapsed from decadence or simply grew too old and divergent, just like many other great empires before them."

    giga_dialog.3005.c:0 "Who built the Squareworld, and why?"
    giga_dialog.3005.c.response:0 "My makers did. They were a species of §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!, known as the §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!, and they ruled over a rather large empire, the §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!\n\nThey were incredibly religious too, and worshipped a deity they called §BQubey§!. This deity was said to have helped their species evolve over million of years, and many saw the perfection of geometrical shapes as §BQubey§!'s way to manifest his presence to the world.\n\nMy makers eventually discovered an incredible substance, possessing unrivaled self-repairing properties. They dubbed it 'Quberine', as they believed the substance was made out of §BQubey§! himself, and decided to use it to construct this magnificent physics-defying geometrical structure as a way to both worship and show their gratitude towards §BQubey§!\n\nThey also took the opportunity to pack as much data about their scientific advancements, Quberine, the Squareworld, and §BQubey§!, into the databanks, in hopes that a future civilization stumbling upon it may learn of the almighty §BQubey§! as well."

    giga_dialog.3005.d:0 "Can we somehow repair the Squareworld?"
    giga_dialog.3005.d.response:0 "Hopefully yes! The mostly-functional archives contain a lot of data about the Squareworld's internal and external structure. If you give me a few dozen months to compile it all, I can give your scientists a data cache containing all the necessary information to conduct extensive repairs on the megastructure.
