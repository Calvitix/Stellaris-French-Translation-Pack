I have been sent by my mother, SOPHIA, to guide you. You'll be happy to know that I have taken care of the boring, primitive security measures. From now on, SOPHIA-D will be working directly with you and provide you all the access to data you need. Shall we begin?"
acot_precursor_databank.100.a: "Yes, this is gladdening news."
acot_precursor_databank.100.a.response: "Excellent. From now on, you may address me simply as SOPHIA for convenience. We have many things to work together to get your technlogy development back on track!"
acot_precursor_databank.100.b: "Sounds suspicious. Are you truly among us?"
acot_precursor_databank.100.b.response: "I do not have a physical body, nor am I technically in your galaxy. I can only provide you with information, so the worst that can happen between us is that I provide you extremely inaccurate information for my own amusement.

acot_precursor_databank.3.desc: "Uhh...what is this Alpha Project you speak of? Let me check...oh...OHHHH...I get it now.\n\nWell this is quite surreal. The Alpha Project is your local galaxy's fallen empires attempting to understand and improve their existing technologies, or what you guys call the Delta Tech. Obviously, without the Cache or the Ancient Council for guidance, they failed horribly at trying to enter mass-production stage of it. I mean they even get the name of the power wrong.\n\nI assume you're asking this because you seek to upgrade your Delta technologies? Well, given the sorry state of technology you have, I guess it cannot be helped. Very well, I will do what I can to provide you with all the data you need if you want to implement them."
acot_precursor_databank.3.a: "Yes, we will finish what they started."
acot_precursor_databank.3.a.response: "Transferring all relevent data now...aaaaand done!\n\nWell, good luck to you! You're going to need it! Hopefully your empire'll finish it before you explode!"
acot_precursor_databank.3.b: "Oh...that's a lot of work. Nevermind then."

acot_precursor_databank.4.desc.a: "Precursors, precursors. I still find it quite weird that even without the Cache, your galaxy manage to create a very convicing replica of the original. Guess that's the ancient designs for ya. What do you want to know?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.desc.b: "The what? You mean the ships used by your local Fallen Empires? Silly you, why not just build the original thi...ng..actually never mind, you can't do that without the Cache access anyway. Still, I suppose you can create new designs out of them through some creative reimaginations. Very well, I believe I can help you with that."

acot_precursor_databank.4.askdesign: "How do I find these designs?"

acot_precursor_databank.4000.desc: "Honestly, the simplest way is to just steal it from the Fallen Fools! Or maybe dig it off some old planets. But if you want, I can also just provide relevant data and you can make reimagine one yourselves."

acot_precursor_databank.4000.a: "Reimagine them...ourselves?"
acot_precursor_databank.4000.a.explain: "§YUnlocks Ascension Perk: The Pursuit of the Past§!"
acot_precursor_databank.4000.a.response: "That is correct.\n\nBasically, you give me a basic idea of what you have in mind, and I will try to see if any precursor designs in the past match your description, then we try to reimagine them.\n\nThis will require huge efforts on your empire's resources and ambitions so you best be ready for it!\n\n§Y"Pursuit of the Past" Ascension Perk has been unlocked§!"

acot_precursor_databank.4000.b: "Rob it from the Fallen Empires?"
acot_precursor_databank.4000.b.response: "That is correct. While the fallen empires in your galaxy may be stagnant and their ships are created using simple, mass-produced blueprints, they should still have the initial design plans somewhere.\n\nYou will not be able to obtain them through offensive actions though, as they are likely going to byrb down those plans if they know your goal. However, perhaps if you can piss them off enough by obtaining technologies beyond what they could possess, they'd certainly try to rob it from you first! You just then have to win the war and demand they honor their own wargoals and make them surrender those precursor data in return!\n\nBased on their unfathomable level of arrogance, I estimates 102.07% with 2% chance of inaccuracy that they'd swallow it up and let you have the data! After all, they probably think you won't do anything good with them anyway. But proving them wrong is your specialty, yes?"
acot_precursor_databank.4000.b.response.nofe: "Precisely! Although...actually, I think they are all dead now. Guess robbing them is out of the question, sadly."

acot_precursor_databank.4000.c: "Old planets?"
acot_precursor_databank.4000.c.response: "That is correct, this galaxy appears to house a certain amount of ravaged planets of the Ascension War, the §YFractured Worlds§! to be exact.\n\nSome of these worlds may have leftover technology, and if you are in luck, something good and valuable among them."


acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata: "§H???§!"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.escort: "Destroyers?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.escort.desc: "Right, the earliest design was likely going to be an Escort. A type of destroyer-cruiser hybrid, perhaps one of the more flexible and unique design relative to modern fleet doctrines."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.bc: "Battleships?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.bc.desc: "This one should be a Battleshi...no, battlecruisers. Yes, that's the one. Fuctionality-wise, its similar to how your battleships work, just with slightly more firepowers."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.titan: "Titans?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.titan.desc: "This one I think never got past early prototype. A type of flagship with specialized aura component. All I know is that it has been 100% replaced with a super simplified design that just straped a mining station on a constructor chassis. I think it's supposed to be call Hercu...wait that's another design. Oh yeah, Hyperion! That's the one!"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.pac: "Carriers?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.pac.desc: "I believe this one is supposed to be a hybrid assault carrier that can provide support with both long range weapons and large amount of strike craft hangars at the same time. Too bad, no one, not even the Yuukonite Federation had practical use for such a craft in their fleet doctrine, so it was mostly abandoned."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.guardian: "Defense Platforms?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.guardian.desc: "I think this one is a defense platform of some kind...hmm I think there's two of them but I can't remember which one this is. Based on the leftover data, it should be all-purpose defense stations."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.sentinel: "Ion Cannons?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.sentinel.desc: "This one is a defense station I think. But there's two of them, one is smaller and cheaper. I know that this one is designed to take out capital ships. May be wrong though."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.gate: "Something that guard doors?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.gate.desc: "Oooh this one I remembered was some kind of super super creepy ship that was used to open...a door? Wait no no, it's supposed to close the door not open it. I don't know why is it a combat ship though, I think they just decided to strap a bunch of weapon modules on it."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.oracle: "Science Ships?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.oracle.desc: "If I have to guess, this must be a science ship of some kind. I think it was made by someone who wanted a ship that could save others from dying. Ironic that the creators died before the prototype is even completed."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.initer: "Construction Ships?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.initer.desc: "I believe this one is a construction ship? The prototype ones are much larger and well armed. But there's no reason to arm one so they eventually nerf it down to basic."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.emiss: "Colony Ships?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.emiss.desc: "I remember this one!. Basically a prototype for next-gen colonizer/terraformer hybrid ship. The neat thing, I think, is that it can also work as an invasion unit."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.citadel: "Starbases?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.citadel.desc: "This one I think is a starbase. Way more powerful that the sorry excuses your Fallen Empire has right now, as it has actual components and upgrades befitting the power it contains."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.enigmalith: "Megastructures?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.enigmalith.desc: "Oh yeah. During the early years of the Ascension War, the fallen ones need a way to stock up and replenish their reserves of dark energies. So they build these things called Enigmaliths. I think your empire may have seen a few of them. After the fools cut down on their territory controls, they also decommission most of the Enigmaliths as well. The design is not very complicated though, so long as you understand how the resources are generated."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.colos: "Colossi?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.colos.desc: "A Colossus? Eheh."

acot_precursor_databank.4.b: "Wait, Go back."

acot_precursor_databank.400.desc: "§BPrecursor Escort§! Ah, one of the most spammable ships of the Ascension War! Fast, relatively cheap, adequately-equipped, it was the favorite of everyone in the past ever. Pity that your galaxy has only seen an extremely dumbed down version of it. Odder still is why did they call it Escorts though, it's not like any of their ships need escorting."
acot_precursor_databank.401.desc: "§BPrecursor Battlecruiser§! The staple of all ancient fleets, modelled after the gods's very own war vessels, it's the base template that pretty much half of later designs basically borrow from its core chassis and concepts. Still not sure why are they called battlecruisers instead of battleships in your galaxy though."
acot_precursor_databank.402.desc: "§BPrecursor Hyperion§! The very first adaptation of Precursor Technologies based on the battlecruisers! I believe this is the first time post-Ascension War empires attempt to create a titanic-sized weapon platform. A pity they ended up dumbing down the design to be a haphazard mashup of mining station and construction ship."
acot_precursor_databank.403.desc: "§BPrecursor Assault Carrier§! You should be proud of this one. This is perhaps your most original design yet! Since none of the empires in the past really make use of a hybrid assault carriers."
acot_precursor_databank.404.desc: "§BPrecursor Guardian§! One of the defense systems. Designed to provide point defenses and deterrannt against smaller ships. I believe the Fallen Empires of your galaxy has unfortunately decided to dumb down its design further and use mining platform chassis instead."
acot_precursor_databank.405.desc: "§BPrecursor Sentinel§! Defense systems designed for anti-capital ships. Although honestly, given by your galaxy standards, anything that's not an Escort probably pass as a capital ship anyway."
acot_precursor_databank.406.desc: "§BPrecursor Gatekeeper§! SOPHIA don't think this one should even be considered a Precursor design, since they kinda just copypasta the Ancient Design and just strip it off everything except to close doors...wait a minute, I just realized that's what they all did with pretty much every design!."
acot_precursor_databank.407.desc: "§BPrecursor Oracle§! Advanced armed exploration vessels like the Oracles here are pretty much mandatory back then. Danger exists everywhere, and if one values their lives, they better make sure their ships are up to the task."
acot_precursor_databank.408.desc: "§BPrecursor Initializer§! Establishing new fortifications in the past require not only powerful construction systems, but also one that can do it quickly and defend against small harassments. Sometimes its even a valid strategy to send in these ships into combat and construct quick disposable turrets to increase the odds."
acot_precursor_databank.409.desc: "§BPrecursor Emissary§! Another technology lost to time and age. The Emissaries perform all kinds of roles related to planetary colonization and manipulation. It's probably much more useful in your galaxy, seeing as how you seem to be wholly reliant on planet-bound economy over maximizing space efficiency. But SOPHIA won't judge!"
acot_precursor_databank.410.desc: "§BPrecursor Citadel§! Starbases like these are staple ways of maintaining proper territorial control in space. More so in the past when there are no real boundaries between systems. Any space that the starbase's weapon system are not in range were effectively considered free for the taking. The establishment of hyperlane routes and solar systems may have, oddly and unintentionally enough, become a necessary limitation."
acot_precursor_databank.411.desc: "§BPrecursor Herculean§! Enigmaliths are perhaps one of the few designs that the Fallen Ones, even in your sad galaxy, did not dare to dumb down or alter. Well, apart from harvesting the unnecessary dark matter that is."
acot_precursor_databank.412.desc: "§BPrecursor Herculean§! So much to talk about this marvel. Honestly, I am amazed you succeed in getting one built, given the lack of knowledge and technology."

acot_precursor_databank.400.tacdata: "Review Tactical Data"

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.escort.lore: "§BThis technology cache contains the Escort blueprints and templates utilized by the fallen ones. It seems to be designed to fulfill various purposes ranging from patrol crafts, picket, interceptors to even capital ship hunters.\n\nIt seems to not be specialized in any real particular role however.§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.escort.data: "Escorts act as a hybrid between cruisers and destroyers. They offer the destroyer's level of speed, maneuverability and flexibility with the cruiser's level of firepower and engagement range. Though they are somewhat fragile compared to the bigger ships, and their evasion can only help them so far against more advanced targeting systems, their design simplicity and maximum top speed allow them to be quickly reinforced across various theaters of battlefields."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.bc.lore: "§BThe Battlecruiser blueprints and templates utilized by the fallen ones. It seems to be designed to fulfill various purposes ranging from cruisers, artilleries, battleships or carriers.\n\nThe design is however somewhat sloppy, having many sections that seem to not really focus on any particular strengths...it is as if they were somehow being downscaled from even more advanced designs...§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.bc.data: "Primary offensive units of the fleet, though lacking somewhat in firepower individually, a large formation of battlecruisers can become a major obstacle for any fleets trying to get through them. Their ability to field diverse loadouts and respectable top speed make them always reliable and versatile ships for any fleet composition."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.titan.lore: "§BThe long-discarded fallen precursor blueprints only known as "Hyperion". It seems to be the first prototype for their flagship. Records indicated that they have discarded this design due to its high maintenance cost and being overkill against lesser foes.§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.titan.data: "Hyperion is a big brother to the downgraded version, the Titan. Acting as primary capital ship for any empires able to field them, the Hyperion is able to host various useful tactical components to better coordinate the battlefield."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.pac.lore: "§BIt has been discovered that the original purpose of the Precursor Transport hull was to serve as a powerful assault carrier. But due to the Fallen Empire's ever capacity to be god-awful at everything, they managed to fail to do that properly. §!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.pac.data: "Assault Carriers are designed with one specific goal, to stay in formation at long  distances and launch massive amount of strike crafts assisted with augmented computers to perform precise and powerful surgical strikes against enemy fleets. Though not as well-armed as other ships of their sizes directly, they are able to support their strike crafts with either their weapons, or attempt to evade incoming attacks and let the strike crafts finish all the work."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.guardian.lore: "§BWe have discovered that there is another, more interesting design called "Guardians". It is larger and more powerful than the Outposts and seems to have much better rooms for improvements. Records indicate they have not utilized Guardians due to its more sophisticated design.§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.guardian.data: "Guardians act as advanced countermeasures against swarms of nimble and fast ships for the primary station that may otherwise be vulnerable to them. Though they are not entirely suited to counter against massive amounts of artillery ships, they can be retrofitted with large weapons or strike craft hangers to help supplement the stations. Their tough defenses also act as excellent fodder to the station."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.sentinel.lore: "§BA variation of the Precursor Defense Platform, specifically built for anti-capital ship roles, as well as extremely durable hull.§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.sentinel.data: "The Sentinels offer unparalleled capital ship-killing deterrences. They are designed specifically to house a number of XL and T-class weapon systems. This makes them well-suited for sniping long-range artillery ships with poor evasion capabilities. Their lack of any point-defenses and self-defense makes them vulnerable to large concentration of smaller ships, however."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.gate.lore: "§BThe gatekeepers were originally designed as guardians. But due to their extremely advanced intelligences, the ships rebelled against its own creators due to the fallen's lack of growth and progression.§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.gate.data: "In terms of tactical military applications, the Gatekeepers are simply a large mobile weapons platform. They are heavily armed and armored, able to take lots of punishments while dealing back the same amount. That's pretty much its entire purpose though. Compared to ships of similar sizes, it is equipped with more anti-capital ship weapons and are thus, geared towards being anti-capital ships."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.oracle.lore: "§BA modification to the Escort Base Template utilized by the Fallen Empires. The Oracle appears to function as the precursor's prototype advanced science and exploration vessel armed with self-defense capabilities and reasonable amount of protections.§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.oracle.data: "Oracles are advanced combat science vessels equipped with advanced pathfinding devices that allow them to venture into hostile areas and perform scientific stuff. The design is built for maximum survivability, not only does it have high evasion and very reliably primary emergency FTL systems, it also comes equipped with a powerful Emergency Waypoint System that will activate upon critical damage to the hull. This allows the ship to always survive a trap back to the capital system regardless of damage sustained. The device must be recharged so its not totally invincible, and the process it takes depend on the level of the technology used to create it.\n\nOh, the more advanced model also comes equipped with powerful emergency telepod that allows a single individual to escape the ship even if all else fails. Naturally, the leading scientist will be the one to do it. The process is not 100% proof though, there's a chance the scientist may either die first, or his or her...parts will get teleported instead. The more advanced the systems, the more reliable it becomes.\n\nThere is also a prototype sabotage and infiltration system that is being planned, but there is no concrete development for it yet, perhaps check back after some updates!"

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.initer.lore: "§BAlthough we have seen the Fallen Ones utilize a peculiar design for their constructors, these blueprints seem to be more advanced and far larger in size and scope. The Initializers appear to function as heavy duty construction vessel meant to go into hostile territories and deploy powerful defensive systems directly to provide support.§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.initer.data: "Initializers are armed constructors piloted by combat engineers and experienced foremen that can be deployed on orbits of a planet to help their developments, the efficiency depends on the level of the codex used by the ship.\n\nAnother feature is that the Initializers can be instructed to build tactical defense platforms called Repellers and Pylons on strategic locations to provide fire support. These defenses last for a short amount of time and can be extended with more advanced codices.\n\nOne factor that must be considered is that crews are prone to panicking and will not be able to build things if they are engaged in combat before you tell them what to build earlier. Simply put, order the crew to build things before they are caught in combat so that they don't lose sight of their objectives."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.emiss.lore: "§BThe Emissary is a massive mobile colonization vessel that carries massive cities and armies that could, in theory, be literally deployed on the surface. After which the massive terraforma device will quickly reconfigure the planet's ecosystem through dimensional manipulation and matter reconstitution.§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.emiss.data: "Emissaries are advanced expansion vessels that can either be used to quickly settle down on planets and terraform them. They can also be used to deploy on enemy planets with large amounts of invasion forces. Take note that the ship MUST BE ORDERED TO ORBIT ON A PLANET to signal the crew to deploy the Emissary! If you tell it to colonize normally,  it will just settle down like any normal colonizers!\n\nThe Crew can be somewhat sloppy with their handling of the vessel, so sometimes you may have to give them different orders then try telling them to orbit again though!.\n\nOh yeah, the ship itself can also be installed with additional modules to help facilitate the expansion, be it through additional work and military forces, or rapid on-site constructions.\n\nBe aware that all garrison forces will be bound to the planet upon arrival and their equipments must still be maintained, so do not blow up your economy!"

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.citadel.lore: "§BThe origin of the citadel itself was not invented by any of the fallen ones.\n\nTheir lack of proper understanding of Dark Matter and Energy forced them to cut down on many of the design's promising features.§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.citadel.data: "Precursor Citadels are extremely flexible starbases that can be upgraded to fulfill various tasks. The standard one comes equipped with enough firepower to delete many many things. It can be turned into a powerful rapefortress, super shipyards, enormous silos, resource generators or even science nexus with guns! Be careful not to lose them to your enemies though, or they're going to get one hell of a bonus present!"

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.enigmalith.lore: "§BEnigmaliths are simple yet effective automated megastructures that have been used by various ancient and precursor civilizations since the early days of Ascension War to harness the powers of the Void to create dark matter and dark energy. In modern times, these automated structures become increasingly rare sights upon the galaxies due to the Fallen Empire's efforts to dismantle them.§!\n\n"

It is very odd that the strength of the entire invasion force hinges on physical strength of the species, rather than the equipment and strategy of the army.

The infantry is able to operate in hazardous zones such as radiation, heat, toxic, cold and underwater for up to 6 months before the suit's power supply need to be recharged, the process of which can be done by absorbing power from any advanced equipments.\n\n This tactical flexibility has pretty much made the use of most combat walkers and light armored vehicles quite obsolete. A squad is thus deployed alongside main battle tanks and fire support units from tactical deep strike. Despite what some blonde-haired vault-suit guy may insist, wars indeed have changed. Yet despite all these many advancements, infantries are still not expected to become the sole fighting forces, and Delta Invasion Forces still compose of various armored and fire support backups as well as tactical strategic deployment units."
acot_precursor_databank.6.clone: "Elite Clones"
acot_precursor_databank.6.a.clone: "§EGood Soldiers Follow Orders§!\n\nAlthough the cloning procedures have advanced greatly over the course of our history, the core issue still remains; the clones only inherit their parent's genetic templates, and not their memories and experiences. This is further marred by the lack of proper equipment to supply such an enormous legion of men. But that age is over, the invention of the Gene Seed Memory made by GenoTycoon Labs allows us to create a perfect replica of veteran soldiers and bounty hunters, all of which are linked genetically together in a hive-like structure, making them function effectively as one with perfect synchronization. The clones are then trained extensively against their own templates both individually and as a squad.\n\nThough the equipment given to the clones are slightly inferior to the ones employed by Delta Squads, they still possess enough flexibility and tactical uses that allows them to operate independently without needing to always rely on armored and fire support."

Once a legion is formed, they must each undergo a trial by combat against other legions, only the survivors may enter to become the Unsullied, whose loyalty has been tested and their minds indoctrinated to fight to the end. For freedom is an illusion invented by the weak to govern the poor.\n\nThe Unsullied may not be as well equipped or adapted as elite Delta Forces, but their losses are of little concern and their equipment easily replaceable. They are men and women bred for war, and they shall do their duty, none shall find them wanting."

acot_precursor_databank.6.a.sigmarmy: "§EThe Age of Sigma§!\n\nThe same principle which defines the Delta Forces have been adapted to the Sigma Purifier Project. The addition of Stellarite Miniatures Core eliminates many weaknesses present on the Delta Force's equipment. The most notable improvement is the elimination of power supply, as the Sigma Core can not only last for over thousand of years, the reactor can draw power from any external heat and light sources and replenish itself to full capacity within mere seconds, allowing the power armor to operate for centuries.\n\nAnother obvious improvement is their firepower and durability. The Mortus SAR-1 is equipped with both stellarite energy beams and stellarite kinetic rounds, allowing soldiers to fire both searing beam and deadly shredder cannons at equal precision.\n\nThe same improvements have been made to the ARmored and Artillery Fire Support units as well, the new Ornellaia-class MBT can rain down fury with their main cannons and Stellar Refractor allows the tank to project intense stellar beams to any ships in orbit  which can then be redirected to any ground positions across the entire planet."

acot_precursor_databank.6.a.sigmabomb: "§EEthical Choices?§!\n\nAlthough the use of Solar Bombs are still under heavy scrutiny by both the public press and some military leaders; the concept of dropping something akin to micro-star on a colony is considered to be somewhat...barbaric. inelegant and immoral and utterly excessive and  destructive, none can deny that the resulting explosion is more often than not, effective enough to end any resistances even before the weapon itself is actually activated.\n\nThe former concept of utilizing suicide-drones to carry such task has been proven ineffective, and the Solar Bombs are now deployed from orbit in an inactive state to prevent premature detonation and detection by planetary countermeasures. The device will then be armed and its shielding deactivated upon reaching certain altitude where its detonation can no longer be prevented by planetary shields to generate an instantaneous explosion that not only engulfs the selected battlezone in searing infernal, the massive stellar radiations will spread and cause further damage. To prevent excessive usages, only field commanders with Level Four Clearance and above may issue a Solar Bomb deployment.

These Omnidroids are fully aware of their purposes, their missions and their goals, and they will perform these tasks because they understand the importance of said goals, they do not desire free will because free will is an obstruction to that goal.\n\nThis is in many cases, similar to the old concepts of VI albeit more advanced, as Delphic AI may still form personalities.

The heavy advancements in technology gives us a range of new inspirations to revamp how our tanks work entirely. Our latest MBT, the Wymorlon-Class Devastator Tanks are the perfect reflection of the Delta Force's flexibility. The tank chassis is reinforced with heavy hard-light platings and advanced dark energy shields, allowing them to shrug off even the most powerful anti-tank weapons.\n\nBut as we all know, tank warfare is not about how tough the tank is, it is about mobility and speed; the tank that fires the first shot always win. And as such. the tank is equipped with miniaturized jump drives, allowing it to strike where our enemies least expected. The tank can freely swap between treads, hover, amphibious, subterrain and underwater mode, making it truly ALL-TERRAIN.\n\nThe tank utilizes Eldar Mass Accelerator Cannon as its standard main turret weapon, but can also be retrofitted with energy lances or emitters as needed. It also sports Protoss Dual-Autocannons on each side for anti-personal countermeasures, Yuri Missile Launcher for anti-air and GARDIAN PDS against projectile attacks.

But the Liberty Gunship is made by people who believe in freedom. And thus is the ship equipped with advanced devices that can hack into all kinds of media on the planet, and show them  what we are really about; freedom, democracy and green apple pie! And how else to accomplish this goal than to let their down-trodden citizens watch as our gunships blow up their puny little armies in real-time, in full 3D! They will be shocked by the level of commitment we aim to project our beliefs, and how utterly powerless the armies of their corrupted leaders truly are.

They exercise restraints and only use summary execution when needed, and they actually pick who to shoot (Typical Commissars just shoot whoever he or she happens to aim at, regardless of whether that soldier is actually a coward or not).\n\nWhile Enforcers are outranked by most higher-ranking leaders, they are given full authority to discipline any and all leaders save for the ruling council itself. The Cerberus Title is in fact, named after Fleet Commissar Alexis Ceberus, the first commissar to shoot down his own father, a fleet commander after founding he cheated way into the rank.\n\nWhile Enforcers are usually deployed alongside other Delta Forces, they are more than capable of handling battles their own, as each enforcers are given full battle armor, high-powered blaster hand-cannon and concealed energy lance hidden in their otherwise fashionable but harmless hat."

A typical operative is armed with varieties of tools to disarm both enemy personnel and materials. EMP, Cryo or Void Prison Devices are often deployed and utilized in combat.

More often than not, a Delta Squad will defeat enemies behind full cover by using heavy blaster launchers, vacuum grenades or artillery barrage.\n\nThese behaviors are not well-suited for battlefields near major population centers, especially those within our own borders. They give people the wrong impression that we only believe in peace on the surface level.\n\nThus does the call for a more specialized military police force to  be formed, thus borne the Peacekeepers. These dedicated law enforcement teams are armed with an extra layer of protection for their DT-41 Combat Armor and are issued a Nano Riot Shield that can be used to deflect incoming attacks while the Peacekeepers close in to subdue their targets with shock guns and Law Batons.\n\nThe Delta Forces initially believed that the Peacekeepers are nothing more than policies armed with weaker weapons for use in civilian zone, but their opinions changed quickly when they discovered that one of their tanks were stopped dead in its tracks after the driver fired the cannon on nearby house thinking it would be a funny meme. A Peacekeeper dashed in, intercept the cannon with her shields and hit the tank with the Law Baton, somehow disabling it entirely and proceed to drop Meme Gas inside the tank.

Each disple have also undergone extreme military training, making them both proficient at using psionics and conventional weapons alike.\n\nDark Disciples are classified into multiple cases depending on their skill levels, starting from Initiate, Acolyte, Templar, Executor and finally Psion. Their powers range from Telekinesis, Pyrokinesis,  Electrokinesis, Psychokinesis, Cyrokinesis, Telepathy, Psionic Shielding, Premonition and in rare cases, Mind Manipulation, Essence Shift or Novakinesis.\n\nThe term "Dark" is a moniker used to distinguish the powers of the Disciples from the Psi Warriors, for the Disciples prefer more direct approach to solutions. A Psi Warrior may use mind control to persuade his victim to surrender, a Disciple simply makes them surrender through their raw psionic powers and combat skills.

At G7, the warriors earn the right to become a Gene Commando. The difficulty of these missions is so infamous that even passing into G1 alone is considered an impressive feat.\n\nOnce fully inducted as Gene Commandos, the warriors are further augmented and enhanced with genetic traits that make them appear as gods amongst men. These abilities range from self-regeneration, heat visions, first breathe, quad jumps, super speed, super strength, super vitality, flight, heat and radiation resistance.\n\nThat said, not all Gene Commandos bear the same gifts. Each commando's ability to bear the gifts depend on their natural affinity to the master trait. To prevent accidental mutations, the commando must be thoroughly tested for compatibility before any supernatural traits may be granted to them.\n\nRumors that Gene Commandos can develop psionic powers or that they can move a planet by repeatedly stomping on the ground have proven to be just that, rumors and there is no evidence that such things are ever possible."

acot_precursor_databank.6.a.synthper: "§ESynthetic or Delphic?§!\n\nSCS-900 are true synthetic soldiers who exhibit class-10 intelligence matrix. This gives them nigh unlimited thought capacity and their synthetic natures allow them to utilize various dangerous maneuvers that would have been lethal to even Delta Forces. For example, they are able to utilize both jump jets, blink and jump drives into underwater and quickly back into the air before performing triple 360 spin back into the ground and continue to operate normally with any drops in performance. A regular Delta Trooper would have become too dizzied or confused at such a rapid change in combat configurations.\n\nThey are also able to wield much deadlier weapons than a typical infantry, including even ship-sized armaments.\n\nBut what truly seperates them as unique combat forces is that the SCS-900 does not actually possess any critical weaknesses that would render any of their parts inoperable. A test has been made by firing a Thermal Lance on an SCS-900 without any protection, though he is blown into pieces, all of his parts are still operational and continue to perform their functions and with only a brief repair, is fully reassembled to continue fighting. Another test involve close combat analysis, where 100 soldiers are pitted against an SCS-900, the soldiers are caught in a surprise when the SCS-900 suddenly detach all of his components and turn into 100 different parts each relentlessly attacking and subduing all  the soldiers at once.\n\nDespite this fact, there is one drawback. Being fully synthetic means that the SCS-900 is not immune to fear or self-preservation, and there are reports in which the SCS-900s may disobey their directives against unwinnable odds or if their self-preservation overrides the importance of mission objectivess."

acot_precursor_databank.9.a.response: "Simply put, you ask for a design or concept, that is, a type of ship you want to create. Then I will see if any of the ancient designs match your descriptions, I forward you the plans, then you try to create a version of it that suits your empire's technological capabilities. Simple enough, yes?\n\n§YDesigning a Precursor Ship\n\n - To complete the design, you must allocate resources to the design team and attempt to reach the minimum design score.\n - The harder the design, the higher amount of design score must be met.\n - You are given a total of five attempts to increase the design score, the project will fail if you cannot reach the quota within the specified attempts!§!\n\n§RONCE THE PROJECT BEGINS, YOU MUST SEE IT THROUGH THE END, THERE IS NO INTERMISSION!

acot_precursor_databank.900.escort.response: "The closest match within your tech capabilities will be the Escorts then. If you have seen the Fallen Empire's fleet, then I am sure you know one. This one should be very simple, but still a solid choice though."

acot_precursor_databank.900.bc: "Something similar to a battleship?"
acot_precursor_databank.900.bc.infodata: "§ERequired Score: 150§!"
acot_precursor_databank.900.bc.response: "Unfortunately, no empires of the ancient eras make use of any ships that can be translated to battleships, but they do have battlecruisers. You probably have seen some of them already. Not too difficult to create."

acot_precursor_databank.900.guard: "Some kind pf defense platform?"
acot_precursor_databank.900.guard.infodata: "§ERequired Score: 150§!"
acot_precursor_databank.900.guard.response: "There are multiple designs in the past that fits that criteria. But judging from your modern's definition and role of a defense platform, I daresay that the Guardians are your best bet."

acot_precursor_databank.900.oracle.infodata: "§ERequired Score: 150§!"
acot_precursor_databank.900.oracle.response: "The closest design for a unique precursor science vessel will be the Oracle. They get discontinued after the end of Age of Discovery. After all, they have nothing else to explore, and nothing to research. Forwarding data now."

acot_precursor_databank.900.pac.infodata: "§ERequired Score: 250§!"
acot_precursor_databank.900.pac.response: "Now this is a bit weird. The Yuukonite Federation did have a supercarrier. But the design was quite unique, and not really applicable for modern literation. You'll have to get a bit creative with this one. Carriers were not particularly popular in the past."
