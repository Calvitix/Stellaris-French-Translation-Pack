 acot_alpha_tech_chain: "Mystery of the Precursors"
 acot_alpha_tech_chain_title: "Mystery of the Precursors"
 acot_alpha_tech_chain_desc: "Evidences of a more advanced enigmatic technologies utilized by the ancient precursors have been found across multiple reference points. The term "Precursor Data Bank Archive" has been mentioned multiple times. Our scientists believe that this archive must be the key to the secrets of the past, an ancient cache of technologies to be opened."
 acot_precursor_tech_find: "Prototype Reactor"
 acot_dm_tech_find_enigmatic_desc: "While we cannot harness the power of Dark Matter yet, our scientists are quite confident that we can begin developing a prototype enigmatic energy first. While this is not a requirement, it should provide a good stepping stone for our ship technologies. This point of interest will be removed at the conclusion of Dark Designs Event."
 
 war_goal_acot_wg_steal_databank: "Technology Acquisition"
 war_goal_acot_wg_steal_databank_desc: "War is declared to acquire technologies off the opposing force who clearly demonstrate the lack of common senses to properly utilize such technologies."
 casus_belli_acot_cb_databank_claim: "Knowledge is Power"
 casus_belli_acot_cb_databank_claim_desc: "This empire possesses key knowledge that will further the progress of the greater good, but their inability to be smart about it demands that such knowledge be passed down to someone who is smarter."
 acot_cb_databank_claim: "Knowledge is Power"
 acot_cb_databank_claim_desc: "This empire possesses key knowledge that will further the progress of the greater good, but their inability to be smart about it demands that such knowledge be passed down to someone who is smarter."
 
 
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1.name: "Mystery of the Precursors"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1.a.desc: "Some of our scientists have been studying the technologies behind the designs of the fallen one's spaceships in an effort to find possible improvements for our technologies. What they have discovered is however something far more interesting. Apparently the energy readings from the technologies utilized by the fallen ones seem to be far lower than one would have expected from dark matter and dark energy-based systems.\n\nAfter a lengthy process of searching and studying, it appears that all of the current technologies utilized by the fallen ones are extremely downscaled and simplified versions of their original prototypes. The term "Precursor Databank Archives" has been heavily referenced across multiple pieces of evidence. We believe that the next stage of dark matter evolution lies within this Databank. We must find a way to access it."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1.b.desc: "Some of our scientists have been wasting time trying to study the technologies behind the designs of the fallen one's spaceships. What they have discovered is somewhat unexpected. They claimed that the energy readings from the technologies utilized by the fallen ones seem to be far lower than one would have expected from dark matter and dark energy-based systems.\n\nAfter a lengthy process of searching and studying, it appears that all of the current technologies utilized by the fallen ones are extremely downscaled and simplified versions of their original prototypes. The term "Precursor Databank Archives" has been heavily referenced across multiple pieces of evidence. They believe that the next stage of dark matter evolution lies within this Databank.\n\nHowever, many others remain unconvinced, believing that these scientists are simply trying to spread false claims to gain more recognition. The [root.GetName] is at it's zenith, and that we should look to conquer the galaxy, not trying to chase old ghosts."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1.a: "And we shall."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1.b: "These claims have merit, we should investigate."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1.b.explain: "It will take some political plays to get the Science Board to agree on further investigation. But the risks should be well rewarded, if these theories are indeed correct."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1.c: "Baseless claims without evidence will be ignored."

 acot_databank_trick_fe: "Art of Deception"
 acot_databank_trick_fe_desc: "The Fallen Ones must possess one of these databanks. Perhaps if we gain enough favor with the Fallen Ones, they can be tricked to allow us to gain access to the databank if we pamper them with enough praise. We simply need them to have high opinions of us somehow."
 
 acot_databank_ask_pmc: "Show Him the Money"
 acot_databank_ask_pmc_desc: "Perhaps the Legendary Smuggler and his notorious Phanon Corps can get us what we need. Knowing his reputation, his services won't be cheap unfortunately."
 
 acot_databank_ask_curator: "Calculating Curators"
 acot_databank_ask_curator_desc: "Perhaps the Curators will be able to help us acquire a databank, provided that we are still on good terms with them."
 
 acot_databank_self_assembly: "Self Assembly"
 acot_databank_self_assembly_desc: "The Databank was of an ancient precursor design. Perhaps we can reassemble a new databank ourselves using current resources. But the databank is useless without data, so we're going to have to harvest loads of minor artifacts to combine them up.\n\n§YUse the Assemble Databank from the Relic Tab to begin the attempt.§!\n§RThere is a great chance of failure doing it this way!§!"
 
 artifact_acot_databank_assemble: "Precursor Databank Assemble"
 artifact_acot_databank_assemble_desc: "Attempt to create a Precursor Databank using minor artifacts and other resources."
 artifact_acot_databank_assemble_effect: "We cannot predict what will happen as the databank that is connected may not be the one we desire. We should prepare for potential risks.\n\nExperts advise us to avoid this approach as the risks seem too far outweigh the benefits."

 acot_alpha_matter_events.9005.b: "Witness the power of the Precursors!"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.9005.b.explain: "Assume the control of the newly risen Precursor Intelligence Faction, and trample their revivers, your former empire into oblivion."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.9007.name: "Ancient Intelligence Awakening"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.9007.desc.a: "Red Alert! Some of our fleets have been hacked by an unidentified rogue machine intelligence!\n\nIntel suggests this is the result of a flawed design made by [event_target:current_uprising_originator.GetName], who is now suffering from a massive machine uprising of unprecedented scale."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.9007.desc.b: "Warning! [event_target:current_uprising_originator.GetName], in their sloppiness to create a Databank without proper understanding, has unleashed a powerful rogue Precursor Intelligence into the galaxy. The Intelligence is now causing massive chaos everywhere.\n\nFortunately for us, SOPHIA has shielded all of our fleets from being hijacked, but we will have to watch closely."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.9007.a: "Damn these idiots! Repel the hostiles!"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.9007.a.explain: "Many empire's fleets, including ours have been hijacked by a rogue berserk AI!"

 acot_alpha_matter_events.100.name: "Precursor Databank Acquired"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.100.desc: "We have successfully acquired a copy of Precursor Databank, now all we need is to analyze and decipher the arcane arts behind it so that it may guide us further in our pursuits of the precursor's ancient histories."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.100.a: "Let us move forward!"
 
 RESEARCH_PRECURSOR_DATABANK: "Decipher Precursor Databank"
 RESEARCH_PRECURSOR_DATABANK_DESC: "Before any more progress on the Precursor Study can begin, we must first learn how to operate and decipher the Precursor Databank and its AI Assistance first."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.name: "Incoming Transmission From You-Know-Who"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.desc.spiritualist: "[root.GetName], it has come to our attention that your empire is seeking knowledge of the past precursors such as ours. What exactly do you plan to accomplish.\n\nYou are not trying to find our weaknesses, are you? Given that you have been such a good follower to the faith, we permit you the chance to explain your actions this once."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.desc.materialist: "This is [From.GetRulerName] addressing to [root.GetRulerName]. Our intelligences have detected that your scientists have been seen snooping around the technologies of the old. Normal regulations suggest we confiscate all plebian's data regarding the dangerous acquisition of forbidden artifacts, but since you have shown to be trustworthy in the past, I shall give you the opportunity to not waste both of our times by explaining to me what is your goal.\n\nHurry up and get this over with, I have some new games to play and I don't want to be here long."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.desc.xenophile: "Greetings to you, [root.GetName]. Rumors suggest that your empire is looking for some old datas regarding the ancient civilizations such as ours. We want to know what your objectives are exactly? If you want to know the histories of extinct species, subscribe to Xenocovery Channel and donate and all the information will be yours."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.desc.xenophobe: "Listen now, [root.GetSpeciesName]. You are amongst the more tolerable idiots in this galaxy, so tell us exactly what are you trying to do by meddling in the histories of our pasts? We have no time for games so do not try our patiences."

 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.a: "We want to bask in your empire's glorious achievements."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.a.response: "Are you now? How very humble.\n\nVery well, enjoy your history lessons then, perhaps you will come to understand why we consider ourselves superior civilizations. Your empire's history is but a fraction of our vast achievements, for ours is a story that spans for eons. Study well, and spread the words of our excellence. Let the...<blah blah blah>\n\n<5 hours later> ...ends the reign of our great expansion. Write those histories down and spread the words to the rest of the galaxy so that it may yet be saved.\n\n<<The agony that our ruler has been subjected to from hours of the Fallen Empire's self-glorifying braggings has caused [ruler.GetHerHim] to lose a portion of [ruler.GetHerHis] sanity, even if [ruler.GetHerHim] is immortal, hive mind, machine overlord, for none can endure such level of ten pounds of crap.>>"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.b: "What is a Fallen Empire? A misable little pile of secrets!"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.b.response: "Enough talk! Have at you!"
 
############################ PHANON
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.name: "Databank Acquisition."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.desc: "Oh? What do you want now? A Precursor Databank, you say?\n\nHmmm...it's probably easier to steal one off the gramps. But I can probably have the Science Division create one for you as well. The choice is yours."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.a: "Another heist?"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.a.response: "It's pretty obvious that the Fallen Gramps have tons of secrets that they never bother to dig. My infiltration team can dig the databank for you. The resources needed will be different this time though, given it's going to be much harder."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.b: "You know which databank we're after right?"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.b.response: "Yes yes yes, oh my god. Good Grief. There's only one Precursor Databank worth remembering...SOPHIA. Heck, even Phanon Corps have a version of her that is a bit less...crazy. Our ZOFIA won't be useful to you though as she only holds the data related to Phanon, not precursor stuff that you're after."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.c: "Maybe next time."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.c.response: "Goodbye then."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.d: "Very well. We have a deal."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.103.d.response: "Awesome! As usual, just sit back and relax while my team does the thing. May take a few weeks or so."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1030.name: "Precursor Databank Acquired"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1030.desc: "A Phanon Corps representative has just contacted us. They have succeeded in obtaining a databank, and are delivering the contents to us now."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1030.a: "Well done."
 
 
############################ CURATORS
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.ask_curator: "Can you help us acquire a databank?"
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.name: "Databank Acquisition."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.desc: "Ah yes, you must be referring to the latest model of the databank, SOPHIA. The Curators do have one in our possession at the moment, but we require her for our own purposes. But we can help you acquire the necessary data to construct your own databank using our templates. This will naturally cost you, of course."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.a: "What do you the databank for?"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.a.response: "To store data, obviously. SOPHIA, as well as most databanks after twelfth-generation have the ability to transfer and store data universally. Each SOPHIA is part of a large network of data networks that are linked between each other, allowing people who have the necessary clearance to view information. SOPHIA is also capable of identifying empires from one another, and can keep their personal accounts safe from another who are not cleared to access their sensitive information. The downside of course, means that your initial SOPHIA will have very limited data to provide, you will have to acquire more data from her afterwards."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.b: "So it is possible to make an entirely new databank?"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.b.response: "That is correct. As your empire may have already considered the approach, you can assemble a "blank" databank that has the necessary systems and interfaces to function identically to the real one. But you'll still need enough pieces of ancient precursor materials and relics to create a working connection system that will allow your databank to receive a personality matrix, which in this case is SOPHIA. Without SOPHIA, your databank is no different than a standard TDA."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.c: "We'll think about it."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.c.response: "Take your time. There're multiple ways in which the databank could be made, but using our service is most likely the safest method, so please take that under consideration."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.d: "Looks like you'll be getting more donations then."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.104.d.response: "Excellent! Our experts will have a new database delivered soon. Please wait just a moment."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1040.name: "Precursor Databank Acquired"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1040.desc: "The Curator Order has just contacted us. They have succeeded in creating a database, and are delivering the contents to us now."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1040.a: "Good!"

 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.name: "Alpha Project Report"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.desc.engi: "After extensive analysis of the Precursor's history of their designs, materials and components, our scientists has finally reached the conclusion that the majority of the reasons that led to the Project's failure lies in their imperferctions in the arts of Hard-Light generation. The density and power level  required to create such components were too large for them to reliably field on a massive scale. The technologies utilized by the Fallen Ones are extremely downscaled, cheaply made and easily reproducable components and materials which would not be feasable for Alpha Project.\n\nWith this knowledge, our engineers now have the rough estimation on how to best contain the powers generated from Alpha Project's devices."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.desc.hist: "Per our instructions, our archivists, historians and master librarians have completed their documentations regarding the reign of the Precursors and their vast histories. The chaotic influences of the Ascension War and the massive lack of coordinations between the science team, the political powers and the military leaders were the major factor that led to the failures of the Alpha Project. Major flaws in internal securities led to the Project being canceled after massive rejections made by various opposing factions, most of which were theorized to be agents employed by enemy powers.\n\nArmed  with this knowledge, our empire has come to a greater understanding of how important strength in unity plays a role in achieving great ambitions. We shall not fail. The Alpha Project will be completed under our flag."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.desc.phys: "Our science teams are pleased to report that their analysis on all Precursor's experimental records have been completed. The key to the success of Alpha Project lies in the optimal balances between Dark Matter and Dark Energy's convergence. The Precursors have failed multiple times to maintain the focus between them which results in massive explosions and a lot of black holes.\n\nAfter some minor setbacks of our own, we have finally completed what they have failed. The Alpha Project gets closer and closer to its completion."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.a: "We move closer to our goals."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.4.name: "Alpha Project Finality"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.4.desc: "We are ready to begin the final stage of the Alpha Project. We have all the resources, the knowledge and the will to see this project through. The time for doubts and concerns are behind us.\n\nThere is no time to be lost! [root.GetSpeciesName]! Science Team! Today, the future is at our door!. We know our duty and we will do it. We fight for our honor, as [root.GetSpeciesName], as [root.GetName], and we fight in the name of [root.GetRulerName]!\n\nAnd if we fail this day, we fail in glory, we fail hero's failure...but we shall not fail NO! It is the enemy who will taste failure and defeat. AS YOU KNOW most of our science teams are stationed in space, prepared to deep strike."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.4.a: "For our future! For [root.GetName]!"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.4.b: "But we should fail anyway. Let's just forget about everything."
 
 acot_alpha_matter_events.5.name: "We are the Alpha. We are the Future."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.5.desc: "It is done, a new age is now upon us. As of today, [root.GetName] has surpassed all the precursors of old. Let the galaxy howl in fear and awe for we are the Alpha, the progenitor to the new age of Enigmatic Technologies. Let all the Fallen Ones be aware, for the tables have been turned. Their reign is at an  end! Our enemies shall be undone!"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.5.a: "We are the ALPHA. We are the FUTURE."
