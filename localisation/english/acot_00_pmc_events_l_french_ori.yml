acot_pmc.9902.title: "The Dimensional Mirror Disabled!"
acot_pmc.9902.desc: "The Dimensional Mirror has been successfully disabled! The Corps's signal is rapidly fading. They won't be able to use it to come back to this galaxy directly now.\n\nWe must be cautious though, if they have the capabilities to build a Star Traveller, we can assume that the Mirror is not that only avenue to travel beyond the veils. It may not happen anytime soon, perhaps not in our lifetime, but we can be certain they will be back to reclaim their assets."
acot_pmc.9902.a: "We must remain vigilant"
acot_pmc.9902.a.tooltip: "This concludes the current phase of Phanon Corps Content, there will not be an actual Phanon Retaliation until further notice."
