Apparently, if we are not as smart as we are, things could have gone much worse. The mechanism could not operate with any kind of materials or resources save for the ones located around the vault. It would have exploded and destroyed the planet in a chain reaction. The system would have also reactively harvested nearby materials to substitute the missing stockpiles, this can include biological and mechanical materials, which would have put the Excavation Team at great risk. Finally, if too much resources were to be provided, the system would have allocated exceeding resources to power up inactive warships and repair damaged hulls through hard-light reassembling. It would have been a disaster as the ships would run on ancient IFF systems and begin their long-forgotten wars over again.\n\nThe Path to the Vault is now open!"

Our stupidity and greed has caused us dearly and the only thing left amongst this shattered world is a small dent of leftover debris.\n\nBut the team is convinced that there is perhaps something left to be studied."

acot_digsite_events.4.b.desc: "§YGhosts of the Past§!\n\nThe Vault has successfully been breached, and the expedition team has made as much study as they can from its interior. The vault is ancient but extremely advanced. Remains of dead aliens are found everywhere, many of which seem to be wearing lab coats and working uniforms. This leads up to believe this ship must have been a science vessel of some kind, albeit on a much larger scale than one typically fielded by any we have seen.\n\nEventually, the team reaches a big chamber which appears to be a reactor room. Perhaps with some kind of power source, we may be able to power up the entire vault again?\n\nIf we are to use more advanced reactors, we will need sufficient resources to install them. The options will not appear if we do not have enough resources or technologies."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.1: "Hmm...use 2200-era Fusion Reactor."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.1.explain: "Ancient though these technologies maybe, they cannot be compared to the awesome reactor our people developed in 2200. It is better to save up resources for more important tasks.\n\nIf this stupid ship cannot operate on a Fusion Reactor, then it clearly is too weak, too pathetic to be of any use to us anyway."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.2: "Zero Point Reactor should do."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.2.explain: "Zero Point Reactor represents the most advanced modern reactor utilized by the galactic community, it generates sufficient output to power even the Juggernaut and requires relatively low costs. It should be sufficient to power up important parts of the ship."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.3: "The Enigmatic Reactor will do."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.3.explain: "The Enigmatic Reactor is designed to operate with ancient technologies like these, and it remains our most resource-efficient reactor overall. Seeing as it has carried us through the expedition thus far, the risks or unforseen consequences should be minimal."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.4: "Use the Dark Matter Reactor."
acot_digsite_events.4.b.4.explain: "Although expensive and difficult to produce, the Dark Matter Reactor is our best bet when it comes to handling precursor technologies such as these. If it involves the Fallen Empire, Dark Matter must be there too down the line."

The only thing the team is able to discover is a black box that contains a single green apple that has been preserved for over 100,000 years.\n\nThis somehow gives the team some semblance of hope that perhaps there could be more of these black boxes, with something worth studying?"

Just as when the team prepares to replace the ineffective reactor with a better one, the device breaks, and the entire interior begins to crumble.\n\nWhatever secrets that is hidden in this vault can thus no longer be studied, and there is nothing else we can do with the massive vessel other than salvage it for materials.

acot_digsite_events.7.a.desc: "§YAn Unexpected Guest§!\n\nJust as soon as the team is ready to pack up and leave, a random unknown pirate ship approaches, there is no one on-board. The only thing of note in the ship is a small datapad with the following words inscribed\n\n§Y"To any who read this. Congrats! You are the dumbest empire to have ever existed in the entire history of the galaxy! I am Captain Trollgun, and this is my gift to you. This ship is scripted to fly to you, the fool who would see a vault of knowledge burnt to ashes just for some trinkets and flashy lights. And why do I know this? Because I too was an idiot like you once. My crew did this exact same move on another similar vault. I am not a scientist; I know now that these vaults are out of my league. And so did many others who have failed before me. This ship is made of all the leftover pieces of technology from each vault, to be passed onto each idiot as a badge of meme. You are one amongst us, brothers. Let your shame be ours, and ours be yours. Carve your empire's name into this ship and let it soar into the next mistake! YEAHHH!"§!\n\nIt would appear that the single green apple in the black box belonged to this Captain Trollgun, who has hidden this ship somewhere. The bottom of the picture is a crude drawing of a guy riding a boat into a star. This seems to depict Captain Trollgun's final fate, unable to accept the fact he has responsible for the destruction of one of the great vaults, has consigned himself to oblivion by steering his escape pod into a star."
acot_digsite_events.7.a.1: "At least the apple was great."
 
acot_digsite_events.7.b.desc: "§YSalvage Operations§!\n\nThe final process  of the salvage operation has been completed. Everything of value has been stripped and repurposed for future use. On the bright side, perhaps this is for the better. It is not like all the old stuff is always going to contain cool technologies right? RIGHT?"
acot_digsite_events.7.b.1: "Yeah...right."
 
acot_digsite_events.7.c.desc: "§EAncient Armada§!\n\nThe team is able to finally access the larger section of the vault. And what was inside was quite telling. Large amounts of ships bearing the designs similar to that of the Fallen Empires are found. Though they bear similar components and technologies, these ships seem to be much more...powerful. It is as if they have been augmented beyond their initial specifications.\n\nAs predicted, the vault's energy readings begin to become unstable, and before we can learn anymore about its history, or what the other smaller section holds, the vault collapses.\n\nThough we are ultimately unable to ascertain the purpose and true history behind this massive vault, these ships will serve us well in battle."

acot_digsite_events.7.d.desc: "§EAncient Designs§!\n\nThe team is able to finally access the smaller section of the vault. The best way to describe what's inside is that it's a treasure trove of knowledge and histories; ancient engineering, technologies, recorded in great details, in thousands. There are designs of ships that of which we have never seen, and prototypes of various technologies that bear striking similarities to that of the Fallen Empire's own ships.\n\nHowever, the vault's energy readings begin to become unstable, and there is not much time. The team downloads what they can of the schematics and evacuate from the crumbling vault. \n\nThough we may never know the true story of this ancient vault or what the larger section holds, these schematics will no doubt be useful to our empire."

Thanks to SOPHIA, we are able to prevent any further damage to the surviving parts of the station. The history of this forsaken place is finally revealed. This vault...no... this entire station was a massive complex built specifically to research and develop precursor ship prototypes. During its founding, countless scientists, engineers, and architects from across the galaxy would come in and work tirelessly to decipher the ancient vessels of the precursors. These precursor ships predate every existing record of any civilizations, their designs extremely arcane and mysterious. In fact, the working prototype was projecting only a fraction if not less of the potential power of the original design.\n\nThe latest prototype designs seem to have been analyzed but were never put into production. Instead, the massive larger sections contain what appears to be the mass-produced versions of the designs which have been simplified.\n\nAs for the fate of the station, now known as §EThe A'merigo§!, it became a massive target for many empires.
