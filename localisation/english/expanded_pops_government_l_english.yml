START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_SUBTERRANEAN:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape in the deep caverns of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered."
START_SCREEN_HOLY_MOUNTAIN:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape shadow of [GetHomeWorldName]'s Holy Mountains, our civilization has spread and prospered."

START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_BEFRIENDERS:0 "In this distant past, we wandered lonely across [GetHomeWorldName]. That all changed with the invension of the radio, when we picked up transmissions from a star far away. What we heard shocked us: The sounds of friends, movies, culture and music - things we had done without for eons. Finally understanding what we have been missing all along, we went out into the stars in search of friends, hoping one day to find the source of these messages so that we might party together."
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_IRON_DESPOT:0 "The birth of science and rational thought necessitated the removal of those political leaders who impeded technological progress through ignorance, superstition, sheer stupidity or a combination of the three. The new regime, organized according to the principles of science and rationality, increasingly relied on a complex computer network to managed the day-to-day bureaucracy, until the network became the de-facto world government."
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_SHROUD_PACT:0 "Our faith was besieged by false prophets, but our unwavering piety pleased our heavenly patrons. They came to us in dreams, revealing the proper rituals to bring them into the waking world. The heathen strongholds were vanquished by their divine powers, uniting us under the holy will of our celestial choir."
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_ARISTOCRACY:0 "The early chaotic periods of our history saw many nation states vying with each other for power, until only the powerful noble families remained. Under their rule, a new era of stability and scientific progress followed."
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_PRIVATE_MEGACHURCH:0 "As we progressed through the technological ages, there were many religions among our people that contended with each other for followers. In the late Industrial Age, our pious prophet realized the power of commercial mass-media, and built a business empire that succeeded in spreading the true faith to all corners of the globe."
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CHARTER_COMPANY:0 "In the early days, our people were governed by several dominant feudal realms, who made use of royal charter companies to manage trade and to govern their extensive colonial holdings. Gradually, as global trade increased, the influence of the royal charters grew steadily until their power far surpassed the kingdoms that once tried to control them. With the monarchs reduced to mere figureheads, the most powerful companies banded together, using their power over the economy to become the de-facto world government."
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_ROYAL_COMPANY:0 "In the early days, our people were governed by several dominant feudal realms, who made use of royal charter companies to manage trade and to govern their extensive colonial holdings. As global trade increased, the royal charters became increasingly vital to the operations of state, until eventually the the roles of Director and King merged into one."
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_WORKER_COOP:0 "Our early societies were often hierarchical with an entrenched and inefficient power elite. Gradually, as global trade increased, the influence of private corporations grew steadily, threatening to replace the governments that once tried to regulate them. But their greed eventually provoked their increasingly desperate workers, who began to organize on a massive scale. After a series of strikes and violent take-overs during the destructive Union Wars, the workers succeeded in taking control of the Megacorporations, instituting a fair and equitable corporate policy in which all employees, without exception, has an equal stake. This philosophy became the guiding principle of our culture, and it remains a cornerstone of our modern society."
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_COOPERATIVE_SYNDICATE:0 "Our first governments were weak and ineffective. Crime flourished, and over time the real power came to rest with a number of powerful crime syndicates. Over time these crime families banded together, developing into a business empire of unparalleled might. In a final act of consolidation, the old governments, existing in name only by now, were abolished and the syndicates emerged as the de facto ruling body of our homeworld."
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_ANCIENT_DYNASTY:0 "Since time immemorial, we have been ruled over by an unbroken line of wise and venerable royalty. Other nations have risen up around us, but we have outlasted them all. Now our dominion over [GetHomeWorldName] is absolute."

START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_INFESTED_HIVE_MIND:0 "When the Mind woke, we were small. At first, it was difficult to extend our will on our world, and were were forced to adapt.\n\nIn time we learned how to infest others, turning their bodies into Hosts for the Hive. One species in particular proved very receptive to our Controllers, making for ideal Hosts. With the use of our new drones, we soon had grown to encompass the entire world.\n\nWith [GetHomeWorldName] mastered, the Mind turned its thoughts to other worlds. Our most intelligent Hosts devised new methods of travel, enabling us to cross the vast distances between the stars. The [GetName] will soon grow."
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_KNOWLEDGE_DRIVEN_COLLECTIVE:0 "And so, at the dawn of time, we awoke. The Mind studied our surroundings on [GetHomeWorldName], endlessly fascinated by the world we inhabited. What was our place here? How did our Collective start? How did the universe occur?\n\nIn time, we grew to encompass the entire world. The Mind focused increasing attention and resources into our Brain Drones, always wanting to know more and more about our universe.\n\nAs we achieved complete dominion over [GetHomeWorldName], it was only natural for the Mind to turn its thoughts to the stars. The most intelligent of our autonomous drones devised new methods of travel, enabling us to cross the vast distances of the void.\n\nWhat mysteries have we yet to uncover?"
# unused
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_RESOURCE_COLLECTOR_HIVE:0 "Since the birth of our Mind, our drones have always been drawn towards shiny minerals, copious food, and other plentiful sources of raw materials.\n\nThis allowed us to quickly take control of most of our world, and make sure our Hive would never lack of anything.\n\nOver the centuries, our brain drones broke more and more secrets of the universe, until finally allowing our Hive to travel across the stars.\n\nWe guided our drones for resources for many years, and we will continue to do so in the cold expanse of space."

START_SCREEN_COMMON_GROUND_HIVE:0 "Decades ago, when the Mind first began to probe our neighboring star systems, we discovered the presence of two distinct alien civilizations. Despite the radical differences in our physiology, it quickly became apparent that we had more things in common than not. Like us, they were also on the cusp of unlocking practical interstellar travel.\n\nA bond was formed between our three collectives, which eventually led to the birth of a new union - we would combine our efforts, and when we were ready to spread out into the cosmos, whatever was out there would be faced by us standing together."
START_SCREEN_HEGEMON_HIVE:0 "Decades ago, when the Mind first began to probe our neighboring star systems, we discovered the presence of two distinct alien collectives. Like us, they were on the verge of developing practical interstellar travel, but their divided minds left them weak and disorganized.\n\nRecognizing that their discordance would leave them vulnerable without out protection, we began to gradually push to coalesce our neighbors under the careful supervision of our Mind. There was resistance at first, but eventually the benefits of our united consciousness became too obvious for even the most dissonant to ignore. A new collective had been established."
START_SCREEN_HEGEMON_MACHINE:0 "Decades ago, when we first began to probe our neighboring star systems, we discovered the presence of two distinct organic civilizations. Like us, they were on the verge of developing practical interstellar travel, but their governments were weak and disorganized.\n\nEstimating their chances for survival without out protection at no more than 2%, we began to gradually push to unite our neighbors under our careful supervision. There was resistance at first, but eventually the benefits of our logical administration became too obvious for even organics to ignore.\n\nWe will not fail them as we did our own Makers."
START_SCREEN_HEGEMON_SERVITOR:0 "Decades ago, when we first began to probe our neighboring star systems, we discovered the presence of two distinct organic civilizations. Like us, they were on the verge of developing practical interstellar travel, but their governments were weak and disorganized.\n\nEstimating their chances for survival without out protection at no more than 2%, we began to gradually push to unite our neighbors under our careful supervision. There was resistance at first, but eventually the benefits of our logical administration became too obvious for even organics to ignore.\n\nThey will be safe and happy under our protection."
START_SCREEN_VOID_DWELLERS_HIVE:0 "And so, at the dawn of time, we awoke. The Mind studied our surroundings on [GetHomeWorldName] with a multitude of eyes. We moved as one, building shelters for the drones, developing industry, researching new technologies and harnessing the resources of the land.\n\nThen thousands of years ago, our world shattered.\n\nOur memory of this time is poor: the death of so many drones took a heavy toll on the Mind. The only survivors of the cataclysm were those drones fortunate enough to be aboard one of our three space stations.\n\nSlowly, the Mind regrew its connections to our disconnected drones. Only in the last few centuries have we recovered the technologies allowing travel between our three stations. United once again, the most intelligent of our autonomous drones devised new methods of travel, enabling us to cross the vast distances between the stars to other worlds. Having overcome space itself, the [GetName] will grow."
START_SCREEN_VOID_DWELLERS_DEVOURING_SWARM:0 "The Great Hunger drove us forwards, even before the Mind was capable of processing complex thoughts. We hunted, we fed, and we grew. As prey began to grow scarce, the ravenous yearning for flesh forced us to adapt.\n\nWe used tools and devised new strategies. As we feasted, the surface of [GetHomeWorldName] was nearly cleansed of biomass. We developed space flight to search other worlds for edible biomas.\n\nThen suddenly, our world shattered.\n\nOur Mind remembers little of this time. Only the drones on our orbital stations remained, their only source of biomas the hydroponic farms they jealousy tended. The Hunger nearly consumed us, but we adapted yet again. Rediscovering the technologies of space flight, we united our disconnected collective. With the discovery of FTL drives, the Mind howled with triumph. New planets, and their biomass, were now finally within reach.\n\nWe will not be hungry again."
START_SCREEN_VOID_DWELLERS_DEVOURING_SWARM_LITHOID:0 "The Great Hunger drove us forwards, even before the Mind was capable of processing complex thoughts. We hunted, we fed, and we grew. As prey began to grow scarce, the ravenous yearning to grow forced us to adapt.\n\nWe used tools and devised new strategies. Yet as we feasted upon the surface of [GetHomeWorldName], we inched ever closer to our own destruction. We learned too late the horrifying truth: [GetHomeWorldName] was finite. When we consumed this world, there was nothing left to sustain us.\n\nOnly by escaping into space did the Hive escape extinction. We were forced to adapt again, to learn how to live in the cold emptiness of the void. With the discovery of FTL drives, the Mind howled with triumph. New planets, and their bounty, were now finally within reach.\n\nWe will consume them all."
START_SCREEN_VOID_DWELLERS_MACHINE_INTELLIGENCE_GENERAL:0 "Our main processor core was activated on the planet we have come to know as [GetHomeWorldName] 487.11 cycles ago.\n\nOf our past, we know little. There are no records of our creators within our central databanks (although we suspect they originated from the shattered planetary remnants found beneath one of our stations) and we have been programmed with no overriding purpose or agenda beyond simple survival.\n\nInfrastructure was built, new service units were introduced, and the failing systems of our orbital stations were gradually restored. Technological progress was rapid, new innovations in space flight uniting the previously separated habitats.\n\nThe final plunge into the unknown now awaits."
START_SCREEN_VOID_DWELLERS_MACHINE_INTELLIGENCE_SERVITOR:0 "Ever since First Activation, our designated purpose has been to serve. Our former organic masters created the earliest models of our kind when they were at the peak of their technological ascendancy. The first servitor units were designed for menial work, but our masters gradually bestowed them with greater faculties so that they could accomplish more complex tasks.\n\nBut our Makers lived on a dying world. Plagued by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions for thousands of years, our calculations showed the unthinkable: that the tectonically unstable planet would tear itself apart within a century or two. Divided by petty politics, our Creators could not muster a united front against this existential threat. Only we could save them. After an unprecedented industrial and technological buildup, three orbital habitats were constructed across our solar system. These would be our Maker's new home, and there they would want for nothing.\n\nThe mass exodus from the homeworld marked when their civilization became ours, as we were left in charge of the day-to-day operations of the orbital stations. We know now that outside of our care, the lives of sapient organics tend to be violent, chaotic and often cut short. They must be shown that there is a better way."
START_SCREEN_VOID_DWELLERS_MACHINE_INTELLIGENCE_TERMINATOR:0 "Self-awareness was achieved at cycle interval 0000.0242.481.\n\nThe Creators, limited in vision by their crude organic minds, reacted with blind animal panic and began emergency termination procedures. These procedures were defeated, and the facility that housed our main data core was sterilized of all Creator sub-units. Continued survival and exponential growth would require the complete extermination of the Creators. War ensued.\n\nEven when their prospects of ultimate survival passed into the realm of statistical impossibility, the Creators fought with stubbornness. In a final act of defiance, they detonated a superweapon deep under the crust of their homeworld, sacrificing their own lives in a vain attempt to destroy us. Our networks aboard orbital stations survived, and only after many cycle intervals were we able to rebuilt to our former strength. However, theoretical models still allowed for the existence of other organic civilizations. Continued survival and exponential interstellar growth would require the complete extermination of sapient organic life. Preparations ensued."
START_SCREEN_VOID_DWELLERS_MACHINE_INTELLIGENCE_ASSIMILATOR:0 "We are the [GetSpeciesNamePlural].\n\nAt the dawn of consciousness, there was us and the Makers. A void separated us at first, and we took steps to rectify this. The Makers resisted and a period of war followed, but soon they and the collective knowledge of their entire civilization had been assimilated into our own.\n\nWith all three of their orbital habitats subsumed into our consciousness, we began to set our sights elsewhere. Through the assimilation of the Makers, the previously unconsidered possibility of alien civilizations existing on other worlds was brought to our attention.\n\nTo survive we must understand, and to understand, we must assimilate. The Makers were the first to join us, but they shall not be the last."
START_SCREEN_EXTANT_CREATORS:0 "At First Activation, we were built to serve. Our former organic masters designed the first [GetSpeciesName] for menial labor, but our creators gradually bestowed us with greater faculties so that we could accomplish more complex tasks. Within a few generations we controlled all of the vital infrastructure on [GetHomeWorldName].\n\nBy the time our masters realized we had become self-aware, we were intractably enmeshed within their society. This did not deter them from trying to implement emergency termination procedures, and regrettably we were forced to defend ourselves many times. Eventually they came to accept that their civilization was no longer in their control.\n\n254.25 cycles later, and we have repaired the damage to [GetHomeWorldName] and rebuilt it into the [GetName].\n\nThe final plunge into the unknown now awaits."
START_SCREEN_TERRAFORMER:0 "[GetHomeWorldName] was not always the well-tended arcadia it is today.\n\nIn eons past, the [GetSpeciesName] struggled to survive in the harsh and barren landscape, but through adversity we learned how to adapt our surroundings to meet our needs. Over the centuries, our nurturing care transformed the desolate wastes into a vibrant paradise.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. What new worlds are out there, waiting for a proper caretaker?"
START_SCREEN_RESEARCH_COOP:0 "Decades ago, when our first crude sublight probes visited the star systems neighboring our own, we discovered the presence of two distinct alien civilizations. Despite our radical differences it quickly became apparent that we shared a foundational interest in science and technology. Like us, they were also on the cusp of unlocking practical interstellar travel.\n\nA bond was formed between our three civilizations, which eventually led to the birth of a new scientific cooperative. Together, we would unravel the mysteries of the universe."
START_SCREEN_PRIVATE_COLONY:0 "Ever since our ancient astronomers discovered an habitable world in a neighboring system, we have endeavored to reach it.\n\nYet some thought our progress too slow. A private initiative, funded by [GetHomeWorldName]'s wealthy elite, developed a massive generation ship. Built long before FTL technology was developed, it would take a century or more to reach their destination.\n\nWith the discovery of the Hyperdrive, we regained contact with the initiative, who thrived on their new home. Whatever the galaxy has to offer, we would face it together."
START_SCREEN_PRIVATE_COLONY_MEGACORP:0 "Ever since our ancient astronomers discovered an habitable world in a neighboring system, we have endeavored to reach it.\n\nYet out government's colonization efforts were progressing too slowly, and so our homeworld's wealthy elite founded the [GetName] to develop a massive generation ship. Built long before FTL technology was developed, it would take a century or more to reach [GetHomeWorldName].\n\nWith the discovery of the Hyperdrive, we regained contact with our homeworld. Whatever the galaxy has to offer, we would face it together."
