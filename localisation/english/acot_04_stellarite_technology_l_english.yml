tech_stellarite_bomber: "Sunrider Bomber"
tech_stellarite_bomber_desc: "Previously, the development of strike crafts have always gone hand-in-hand between bombers and fighters. While such a method makes it easy to create a modular design that works for both classes, it also limits their true potentials.\n\nAs such, the new stellarite-powered bombers will be designed separately. Due to the stellarite reactor being much different than the precursor's schematics. we are forced to go back to a more modern hull design."

tech_warp_stellarite_cannon_desc: "There is only so much pure kinetic force can do as ship protections and defenses keep getting stronger and energy weapons quickly dominating the fields, our scientists seek better ways to improve our current mass accelerators. While the concept sounds weird and quite dumb, it may be possible to instead turn the entire cannon into a powerful warphole generator that can tear a fabric of space and sends the warhead inside enemy ship, bypassing shields and travelling distance completely. The only issue as of now, is how to do that while still maintaining the speed and velocity of the projectile?"
 
ACOT_TITAN_CANNON_SE: "Titan Warp Stellarcannon"
ACOT_TITAN_CANNON_SE_DESC: "Imagine firing a miniature star into an enemy ship's interior...then imagine firing a star about to go supernova into that ship...get the picture?"
