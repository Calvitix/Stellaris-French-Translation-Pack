#### PRECARSOR TECH #####

tech_fe_tower_offense: "Precursor Sentinel Schematics"
tech_fe_tower_offense_desc: "A variation of the Precursor Defense Platform, specifically built for anti-capital ship roles, as well as extremely durable hull."

tech_precursor_design: "Precursor Databank Analysis"
tech_precursor_design_desc: "In order to understand more about the history of the Precursors, an analysis and activation of the Databank AI Assistant must be done.\n\nOnce we finished our analysis and determine whether the the AI will pose a threat to our security or not, we may decide on what to begin next."

tech_precursor_design_engineering: "Alpha Project: Precursor Engineering"
tech_precursor_design_engineering_desc: "A comprehensive and thorough study on how the Precursors of the past developed various materials, designs, prototypes and ships will give us a rough understanding on how to best create components that can sustain and contain the powers of the new energy source from Alpha Project."

tech_precursor_design_history: "Alpha Project: Precursor History"
tech_precursor_design_history_desc: "A massive documentary and records from the past must be studied. We must understand the failures of the Precursors, of their painful pasts so that we will not repeat them. Each chapter will give us the rough idea of the scope of our true objective, the Alpha Ascension."

tech_precursor_design_physics: "Alpha Project: Precursor Experiments"
tech_precursor_design_physics_desc: "An enormous pile of data caches regarding the Precursor's attempts to break through the limits of Dark Matter and Dark Energy field manipulations must be documented. Only then will we be able to understand the true powers and limitations of the Alpha Project, then we shall eliminate those limitations and surpass the Fallen Ones."

tech_precursor_escort: "Escort Base Template"
tech_precursor_escort_desc: "This technology cache contains the Escort blueprints and templates utilized by the fallen ones. It seems to be designed to fulfill various purposes ranging from patrol crafts, picket, interceptors to even capital ship hunters.\n\nIt seems to not be specialized in any real particular role however."

tech_precursor_bc: "Battlecruiser Base Template"
tech_precursor_bc_desc: "This technology cache contains the Battlecruiser blueprints and templates utilized by the fallen ones. It seems to be designed to fulfill various purposes ranging from cruisers, artilleries, battleships or carriers.\n\nThe design is however somewhat sloppy, having many sections that seem to not really focus on any particular strengths...it is as if they were somehow being downscaled from even more advanced designs..."

tech_fe_assault_carrier: "Precursor Assault Carrier Blueprints"
tech_fe_assault_carrier_desc: "It has been discovered that the original purpose of the Precursor Transport hull was to serve as a powerful assault carrier. But due to the Fallen Empire's ever capacity to be god-awful at everything, they managed to fail to do that properly. We will correct their mistakes."

tech_precursor_titan: "Precursor Hyperion Blueprints"
tech_precursor_titan_desc: "This technology cache contains the long-discarded fallen precursor blueprints only known as "Hyperion". It seems to be the first prototype for their flagship. Records indicated that they have discarded this design due to its high maintenance cost and being overkill against lesser foes.\n\nThere is also a comment that the ship's large profile made it vulnerable to the "Elders". Nevertheless, the fallen precursors still wanted to implement the ship's titanic spinal module. So they retrofitted the parts on one of their existing hulls and called them Titans.\n\nIt seems the Fallen Titans they have nowadays are basically a militarized civilian ship made out of construction ship hull with a mining station's perdition turret strapped on top of it. That is...something.``

tech_gatekeepers: "Gatekeeper Schematics"
tech_gatekeepers_desc: "Based upon the records of the fallen precursors, the gatekeepers were originally designed as guardians. But due to their extremely advanced intelligences, the ships rebelled against its own creators due to the fallen's lack of growth and progression.\n\nThe designs we have at the moment seems to be heavily toned down from the initial descriptions. A likely theory is that the original design must have been much stronger.\n\nNevetheless, this is an extremely formidable capital ship design that should not be overlooked."

tech_precursor_guardian: "Precursor Guardian Schematics"
tech_precursor_guardian_desc: "There seems to be multiple records and design variations for the defense platforms utilized by the fallen precursors, the most well-known one is the Defense Outpost that we have seen the fallen used regularly. But we have discovered that there is another, more interesting design called "Guardians". It is larger and more powerful than the Outposts and seems to have much better rooms for improvements. Records indicate they have not utilized Guardians due to its more sophisticated design. They preferred to use Outposts which are easier to build, as its hull are basically made out of the same as mining stations. Such hedonistic tendencies are what led them to their downfall."

tech_precursor_escort_delta: "Modular Escort Design"
tech_precursor_escort_delta_desc: "It is past time we get rid of the inflexibilities of the fallen ships. We will implement more modern templates that will be much stronger, but also offer new variations for the Escort."

tech_precursor_bc_delta: "Modular Battlecruiser Design"
tech_precursor_bc_delta_desc: "It is past time we get rid of the inflexibilities of the fallen ships. We will implement more modern templates that will be much stronger, but also offer new variations for the Battlecruiser."

tech_precursor_colossus: "Herculean Battlestation"
tech_precursor_colossus_desc: "This data reveeals the hidden truth. The colossi that the fallen precursors used were in fact incompleted...it is only one portion of a much larger weapon. This "Herculean" is a massive battlestation dwarfing even citadels. The ship is massive enough that it can support two primary reactors and has a built-in self-repair protocol that allows it to repair its hull to full conditions as soon as it reaches critical damage for the first time. The "Colossus" portion makes up the inner layer of the station. It seems the fallen empire decided to strip down the original design and only utilized the Colossus Section for their world-altering weapons.\n\nThis does not make a lot of sense...why would the fallen precursors decide to give us this schematics? Perhaps they think that we won't be able to build such a massive vessel? Is there a hidden exhaust port somewhere that may blow up the ship in one hit? We can only guess."

tech_precursor_sigma_citadel: "Sigma Citadel Project"
tech_precursor_sigma_citadel_desc: "While the Precursor Citadel is flexible, reliable and very well armed, it relies heavily on Dark Matter and Dark Energy-based technology. Now that we are beginning to reach the age of Stellarite, we should explore new ways to improve the design of the Precursor into Sigma variant."

tech_precursor_citadel: "Precursor Citadel Design Plans"
tech_precursor_citadel_desc: "The Fallen Empire's citadels have long stood against the test of times, the massive central obelisk provided its station with almost limitless power. Yet the design seemed sloppy, uncompleted. For the longest of times we theorized it to simply be due to old age, but this design plans have given us new revelations; the origin of the citadel itself was not invented by any of the fallen ones.\n\nTheir lack of proper understanding of Dark Matter and Energy forced them to cut down on many of the design's promising features. Ultimately, the station they have now is nothing more than a replica, built to look impressive to scare younger races. But now it is time we show the fallen ones the difference between perfection and pretension.\n\nDue to the station's complex mechanisms, the framework must be constructed as part of a megastructure before the real work can begin."

tech_precursor_science: "Precursor Oracle Design Plans"
tech_precursor_science_desc: "This schematic seems to be a modification to the Escort Base Template utilized by the Fallen Empires. The Oracle appears to function as the precursor's prototype advanced science and exploration vessel armed with self-defense capabilities and reasonable amount of protections. What makes this design interesting is that it seems to possess the ability to engage emergency waypoint teleportation that allows the vessel to immediately escape from any space battles.\n\nIt seems the design was never finalized due to the wars between precursors demanding more attention to warships over explorers and the lack of motivation to explore the known galaxy."

tech_precursor_construcor: "Precursor Initializer Systems"
tech_precursor_construcor_desc: "Although we have seen the Fallen Ones utilize a peculiar design for their constructors, these blueprints seem to be more advanced and far larger in size and scope. The Initializers appear to function as heavy duty construction vessels meant to go into hostile territories and deploy powerful defensive systems directly to provide support. It seems to also function as planet-side construction network that can massively increase the planet's construction progress by deploying large amounts of servitor probes.\n\nThe current state of the Fallen Ones make the design unfavorable and the project never reached their final conclusion."

tech_precursor_colonizer: "Precursor Emissary MCV"
tech_precursor_colonizer_desc: "During the ancient galactic-scale war known as the Ascension War, planets became major playing grounds for all factions and little to no unoccupied planets were left untouched. The inconveniences of deploying large invasion fleets on planet surfaces to eradicate surface resistances, followed up by the lengthy process of re-colonization of the planet caused the  Precursors to revisit their approach to expansion. The Emissary is a massive mobile colonization vessel that carries massive cities and armies that could in theory, be literally deployed on the surface. After which the massive terraforma device will quickly reconfigure the planet's ecosystem through dimensional manipulation and matter reconstitution.\n\nThe lack of any Emissaries in use by the Fallen Ones seem to suggest the project never came to fruition, and the standard colonizer is used to colonize new planets instead due to its simpler and easy-to-replicate materials."
