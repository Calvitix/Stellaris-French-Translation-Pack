acot_precursor_databank.3.desc: "The Alpha Project...but of course. What a great massive failure made by my very own generations, Woooeh!\n\nSee here, during the War of Ascension, everyone's trying to get themselves an edge over their enemies, sounds familiar?. But due to the unmeasurable amount of chaos of the galaxy, no one was able to develop anything useful before they died or the projects got cancelled. Even if they did manage to make something, the technologies would get replicated, the resources required to mass-produce it would then be impossible to acquire. The longer the war went on, the more and more the lines between friends and foes became more unclear. Eventually scientists found themselves working for multiple factions, each demanding their own weapons to further their agendas with little concerns for others. Did not take long for things to go downhill afterwards.\n\nUltimately, countless prototypes and technologies were conceptualized but none would ever come to see the light of day, the entire concept would be known as the Alpha Project. If you want to continue this legacy, I can give you a bunch of these past records of their histories but you better find some ways to narrow down the stuff, since there are massive loads of stuff in there, most of which probably made no sense. To give you an idea, there was an experiment to put an animal inside a Dark Matter Conduit and then throws a bunch of apples on top of it in an effort to create Class-15 Singularity, the end result is that the lab was torn apart and a giant panda the size of a battleship emerged and started murdering everything with its weird as hell martial-arts move. It took the combined efforts of twelve empire's special forces to finally eat it."
acot_precursor_databank.3.a: "Yes, we will finish what they started."
acot_precursor_databank.3.a.response: "Transferring all relevent data now...aaaaand done! Yee-haw!\n\nWell, good luck to you buddy! You're going to need it! Hopefully your empire'll finish it before SOPHIA is replaced with someone else! Gooood Byeeeeee!"

acot_precursor_databank.4.desc.b: "The what? You mean those creepy vertical ships used by uhhh...I can't even remember how many empires used to duplicate from the old prototype. None ever came close to actually getting them working beyond just being super dumbed down designs though.\n\nAnyway, while I know all the existing ship designs, I can't actually access them without proper authorization code you'd obtain from knowing the thing so I can't help you here, bro. You can try to press some of the buttons, I may be able to tell you what it's supposed to be based on my understanding."

acot_precursor_databank.4.askdesign: "How do I find these designs?"

acot_precursor_databank.412.desc: "Ah, so you want to obtain more of the old designs? SOPHIA can help!\n\nThe simplest way is to just steal it from the Fallen Fools! Or maybe dig it off some old planets or perhaps you can just try to reimagine them yourselves with SOPHIA's help if you're that despe...serious about obtaining those designs."

acot_precursor_databank.412.b: "Rob it from the Fallen Empires?"
acot_precursor_databank.412.b.response: "Correct! But there's a trick, since the Fallen Nubs won't just let you do that so easily. They have no real uses for those data and if they know you're coming for them  directly, they may just purge all those data!\n\nBut perhaps if you can piss them off enough by obtaining technologies beyond what they could possess...like the Alpha Project, they'd certainly try to rob it from you first! You just then have to win the war and demand they honor their own wargoals and make them surrender those precursor datas in return!\n\nThose Fallen Chickens are too prideful, SOPHIA estimates 102.07% with 2% chance of inaccuracy that they'd swallow it up and let you have the data!"

acot_precursor_databank.412.c: "Old planets?"
acot_precursor_databank.412.c.response: "Yeppers, really really super oldy old planets. Like those brown creepy §YRelic Worlds§! or those glowing weird §YFractured Worlds§!!\n\nThose are planets that used to have all those cool stuff back when they were the meta. Some of them are bound to still have those relics in there, they are made to last.\n\nOh, do be careful though, these kinds of things usually have A LOT of security measures in them."

acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.escort: "Hmm...I think that one's supposed to be the Escargot..wait no, Escort or something. I think its basically a cruiser-sized destroyer. The Fallen Idiots have them right? Why not just copy from them :3"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.bc: "I think this one is a battleshi...wait no no, the old dudes stop using battleships after...uh someetimes. I think it's supposed to be larger than a cruiser or something."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.titan: "This one I think never got past early prototype. All I know is that it has been 100% replaced with a super simplified design that just straps a mining station on a constructor chassis.

acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.pac: "I believe this one is supposed to be a carrier or something that just runs away from everything and just shat out loads of strike crafts. I think they gave up trying to make it and just turn the existing prototypes into transports."

acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.sentinel: "This one is a defense station I think. But there's two of them, one is smaller and cheaper. I know that this one is supposed to have a very creepy eye in the middle and is very good at shooting big things. Which means it must be the bigger one!"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.gate: "Oooh this one I remembered was some kind of super super creepy ship that was used to open...a door? Wait no no, it's supposed to close the door not open it. I don't know why is it a combat ship though, I think they just decided to strap a bunch of weapon modules on it."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.oracle: "If I have to guess, this must be a science ship of some kind. I think it was made by someone who wanted a ship that could save others from dying. Ironic that the creators died before the prototype is even completed."

acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.emiss: "The UFO! I remember this  one!. It was designed to land on planets...that's the end of it I think...LOOK SOPHIA CAN'T REALLY HELP YOU UNLESS YOU HAVE THE ACTUAL DATA FOR ME TO ANALYZE."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.citadel: "This one I think is a station. It's a station that builds ships and shoots at things. So uhh that's pretty much what a station does. SOPHIA will try harder next time."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.colos: "This one...oh...ai yi yahhh. Just thinking about it makes me want to cry <sob>. It could have been so greattttt.\n\nOops, sorry got distracted. It's a very very very super awesomely amazingly big ship! Actually I think it's more of a station than a ship.

SOPHIA don't think this one should even be considered a Precursor design, since they kinda just copypasta the Ancient Design and just strip it off everything except to close doors...wait a minute, I just realized that's what they all did with pretty much every design!."
acot_precursor_databank.407.desc: "§BPrecursor Oracle§! The overpriced science ship! Just kidding...even if considering the current state of the galaxy, it's not that far fetched. Back in the old days, everyone was so serious about it, thinking that having an armed and armored science vessel that can not be blown up is super cool...until they remembered they don't have any scientists that want a tour of duty anymore."
acot_precursor_databank.408.desc: "§BPrecursor Initializer§! The OG Construction Ship for the real men! This one was rarely produced back then because there was not much point in building things that will be stolen after a month or two.

acot_precursor_databank.409.desc: "§BPrecursor Emissary§! I AM THE EMISSARY OF KAIN! Ooops..sorry that was a quote from one of the old video games made by some species called uhh...EA...I think? They were predators who ate other weaker species and claimed their technologies for themselves, then massively messed them all up until little traces of the original designs and concepts were left. They were gone a long time ago, got blown up by another species called Bethesdans or something\n\nUh..oh right, Emissaries. The old dudes were trying hard to get it to work without messing up the planet but that did not work out so well for them haha."
acot_precursor_databank.410.desc: "§BPrecursor Citadel§! The Prototype Awesomely awesome Citadel that got discontinued pretty super early!

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.escort.data: "Escorts act as a hybrid between cruisers and destroyers. They offer the destroyer's level of speed, maneuverability and flexibility with the cruiser's level of firepower and engagement range. Though they are somewhat fragile compared to the bigger ships, and their evasion can only help them so far against more advanced targeting systems, their design simplicity and maximum top speed allow them to be quickly reinforced across various theaters of battlefields."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.bc.lore: "§BThe Battlecruiser blueprints and templates utilized by the fallen ones. It seems to be designed to fulfill various purposes ranging from cruisers, artilleries, battleships or carriers.\n\nThe design is however somewhat sloppy, having many sections that seem to not really focus on any particular strengths...it is as if they were somehow being downscaled from even more advanced designs...§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.bc.data: "Primary offensive units of the fleet, though lacking somewhat in firepower individually, a large formation of battlecruisers can become a major obstacle for any fleets trying to get through them. Their ability to field diverse loadouts and respectable top speed make them always reliable and versatile ships for any fleet composition."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.titan.lore: "§BThe long-discarded fallen precursor blueprints only known as "Hyperion". It seems to be the first prototype for their flagship. Records indicated that they have discarded this design due to its high maintenance cost and being overkill against lesser foes.§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.titan.data: "Hyperion is a big brother to the downgraded version, the Titan. Acting as primary capital ship for any empires able to field them, the Hyperion is able to host various useful tactical components to better coordinate the battlefield."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.pac.lore: "§BIt has been discovered that the original purpose of the Precursor Transport hull was to serve as a powerful assault carrier. But due to the Fallen Empire's ever capacity to be god-awful at everything, they managed to fail to do that properly. §!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.pac.data: "Assault Carriers are designed with one specific goal, to stay in formation at long  distances and launch massive amount of strike crafts assisted with augmented computers to perform precise and powerful surgical strikes against enemy fleets. Though not as well-armed as other ships of their sizes directly, they are able to support their strike crafts with either their weapons, or attempt to evade incoming attacks and let the strike crafts finish all the work."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.guardian.lore: "§BWe have discovered that there is another, more interesting design called "Guardians". It is larger and more powerful than the Outposts and seems to have much better rooms for improvements. Records indicate they have not utilized Guardians due to its more sophisticated design.§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.guardian.data: "Guardians act as advanced countermeasures against swarms of nimble and fast ships for the primary station that may otherwise be vulnerable to them. Though they are not entirely suited to counter against massive amounts of artillery ships, they can be retrofitted with large weapons or strike craft hangers to help supplement the stations. Their tough defenses also act as excellent fodder to the station."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.sentinel.data: "The Sentinels offer unparalleled capital ship-killing deterrences. They are designed specifically to house a number of XL and T-class weapon systems. This makes them well-suited for sniping long-range artillery ships with poor evasion capabilities. Their lack of any point-defenses and self-defense makes them vulnerable to large concentration of smaller ships, however."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.gate.lore: "§BThe gatekeepers were originally designed as guardians. But due to their extremely advanced intelligences, the ships rebelled against its own creators due to the fallen's lack of growth and progression.§!\n\n"
acot_precursor_databank.400.a.gate.data: "In terms of tactical military applications, the Gatekeepers are simply a large mobile weapons platform. They are heavily armed and armored, able to take lots of punishments while dealing back the same amount. That's pretty much its entire purpose though. Compared to ships of similar sizes, it is equipped with more anti-capital ship weapons and are thus, geared towards being anti-capital ships."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.oracle.lore: "§BA modification to the Escort Base Template utilized by the Fallen Empires. The Oracle appears to function as the precursor's prototype advanced science and exploration vessel armed with self-defense capabilities and reasonable amount of protections.§!\n\n"

The design is built for maximum survivability, not only does it have high evasion and very reliably primary emergency FTL systems, it also comes equipped with a powerful Emergency Waypoint System that will activate upon critical damage to the hull. This allows the ship to always survive a trap back to the capital system regardless of damage sustained. The device must be recharged so its not totally invincible, and the process it takes depend on the level of the technology used to create it.\n\nOh, the more advanced model also comes equipped with powerful emergency telepod that allows a single individual to escape the ship even if all else fails. Naturally, the leading scientist will be the one to do it. The process is not 100% proof though, there's a chance the scientist may either die first, or his or her...parts will get teleported instead. The more advanced the systems, the more reliable it becomes.\n\nThere is also a prototype sabotage and infiltration system that is being planned, but there is no concrete development for it yet, perhaps check back after some updates!"

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.initer.lore: "§BAlthough we have seen the Fallen Ones utilize a peculiar design for their constructors, these blueprints seem to be more advanced and far larger in size and scope.

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.initer.data: "Initializers are armed constructors piloted by combat engineers and experienced foremen that can be deployed on orbits of a planet to help their developments, the efficiency depends on the level of the codex used by the ship.\n\nAnother feature is that the Initializers can be instructed to build tactical defense platforms called Repellers and Pylons on strategic locations to provide fire support. These defenses last for a short amount of time and can be extended with more advanced codices.\n\nOne factor that must be considered is that crews are prone to panicking and will not be able to build things if they are engaged in combat before you tell them what to build earlier. Simply put, order the crew to build things before they are caught in combat so that they don't lose sight of their objectives."

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.emiss.lore: "§BThe Emissary is a massive mobile colonization vessel that carries massive cities and armies that could, in theory, be literally deployed on the surface.

They can also be used to deploy on enemy planets with large amounts of invasion forces. Take note that the ship MUST BE ORDERED TO ORBIT ON A PLANET to signal the crew to deploy the Emissary! If you tell it to colonize normally,  it will just settle down like any normal colonizers!\n\nThe Crew can be somewhat sloppy with their handling of the vessel, so sometimes you may have to give them different orders then try telling them to orbit again though!.\n\nOh yeah, the ship itself can also be installed with additional modules to help facilitate the expansion, be it through additional work and military forces, or rapid on-site constructions.\n\nBe aware that all garrison forces will be bound to the planet upon arrival and their equipments must still be maintained, so do not blow up your economy!"

acot_precursor_databank.400.a.citadel.lore: "§BThe origin of the citadel itself was not invented by any of the fallen ones.\n\nTheir lack of proper understanding of Dark Matter and Energy forced them to cut down on many of the design's promising features.§!\n\n"

Nothing feel better than BOMBING THE CRAP out of your enemies from the surface with some advanced mega-thermobomb artilleries of destruction, or drown their forts with billions of drones armed with buzzsaws and extremely loud music speakers!"

acot_precursor_databank.6.a.darkarmy: "§!War Has Changed...Or has it?\n\nWith the invention of advanced nano-technologies and hard-light manipulation, it is now possible to equip ground infantry divisions with enough firepowers and protections akin to armored vehicles.\n\nA standard equipment of Delta-Kill Team Squads includes various anti-personal and anti-material loadouts, personal kinetic and energy barriers, hard-light neutronium armor, techops helmet with real-time tactical display, satellite radar, short-ranged blink teleportion device, jump packs, auto-medkit and auto-rations that can last for up to 2 years.\n\nThe armor is also equipped with autocamo system, allowing infantry to disguise and blend in with the environment from named eyes, limited stealth system that are undetectable by most type of sensors at long range. The infantry is able to operate in hazardous zones such as radiation, heat, toxic, cold and underwater for up to 6 months before the suit's power supply need to be recharged, the process of which can be done by absorbing power from any advanced equipments.\n\n This tactical flexibility has pretty much made the use of most combat walkers and light armored vehicles quite obsolete. A squad is thus deployed alongside main battle tanks and fire support units from tactical deep strike. Despite what some blonde-haired vault-suit guy may insist, wars indeed have changed. Yet despite all these many advancements, infantries are still not expected to become the sole fighting forces, and Delta Invasion Forces still compose of various armored and fire support backups as well as tactical strategic deployment units."
acot_precursor_databank.6.clone: "Elite Clones"
acot_precursor_databank.6.a.clone: "§EGood Soldiers Follow Orders§!\n\nAlthough the cloning procedures have advanced greatly over the course of our history, the core issue still remains; the clones only inherit their parent's genetic templates, and not their memories and experiences. This is further marred by the lack of proper equipment to supply such an enormous legion of men. But that age is over, the invention of the Gene Seed Memory made by GenoTycoon Labs allows us to create a perfect replica of veteran soldiers and bounty hunters, all of which are linked genetically together in a hive-like structure, making them function effectively as one with perfect synchronization. The clones are then trained extensively against their own templates both individually and as a squad.\n\nThough the equipment given to the clones are slightly inferior to the ones employed by Delta Squads, they still possess enough flexibility and tactical uses that allows them to operate independently without needing to always rely on armored and fire support."

Once a legion is formed, they must each undergo a trial by combat against other legions, only the survivors may enter to become the Unsullied, whose loyalty has been tested and their minds indoctrinated to fight to the end. For freedom is an illusion invented by the weak to govern the poor.\n\nThe Unsullied may not be as well equipped or adapted as elite Delta Forces, but their losses are of little concern and their equipment easily replaceable. They are men and women bred for war, and they shall do their duty, none shall find them wanting."

acot_precursor_databank.6.a.sigmarmy: "§EThe Age of Sigma§!\n\nThe same principle which defines the Delta Forces have been adapted to the Sigma Purifier Project. The addition of Stellarite Miniatures Core eliminates many weaknesses present on the Delta Force's equipment. The most notable improvement is the elimination of power supply, as the Sigma Core can not only last for over thousand of years, the reactor can draw power from any external heat and light sources and replenish itself to full capacity within mere seconds, allowing the power armor to operate for centuries.\n\nAnother obvious improvement is their firepower and durability. The Mortus SAR-1 is equipped with both stellarite energy beams and stellarite kinetic rounds, allowing soldiers to fire both searing beam and deadly shredder cannons at equal precision.\n\nThe same improvements have been made to the ARmored and Artillery Fire Support units as well, the new Ornellaia-class MBT can rain down fury with their main cannons and Stellar Refractor allows the tank to project intense stellar beams to any ships in orbit  which can then be redirected to any ground positions across the entire planet."

The device will then be armed and its shielding deactivated upon reaching certain altitude where its detonation can no longer be prevented by planetary shields to generate an instantaneous explosion that not only engulfs the selected battlezone in searing infernal, the massive stellar radiations will spread and cause further damage. To prevent excessive usages, only field commanders with Level Four Clearance and above may issue a Solar Bomb deployment.

The heavy advancements in technology gives us a range of new inspirations to revamp how our tanks work entirely. Our latest MBT, the Wymorlon-Class Devastator Tanks are the perfect reflection of the Delta Force's flexibility. The tank chassis is reinforced with heavy hard-light platings and advanced dark energy shields, allowing them to shrug off even the most powerful anti-tank weapons.\n\nBut as we all know, tank warfare is not about how tough the tank is, it is about mobility and speed; the tank that fires the first shot always win. And as such. the tank is equipped with miniaturized jump drives, allowing it to strike where our enemies least expected. The tank can freely swap between treads, hover, amphibious, subterrain and underwater mode, making it truly ALL-TERRAIN.\n\nThe tank utilizes Eldar Mass Accelerator Cannon as its standard main turret weapon, but can also be retrofitted with energy lances or emitters as needed. It also sports Protoss Dual-Autocannons on each side for anti-personal countermeasures, Yuri Missile Launcher for anti-air and GARDIAN PDS against projectile attacks.

But the Liberty Gunship is made by people who believe in freedom. And thus is the ship equipped with advanced devices that can hack into all kinds of media on the planet, and show them  what we are really about; freedom, democracy and green apple pie! And how else to accomplish this goal than to let their down-trodden citizens watch as our gunships blow up their puny little armies in real-time, in full 3D!

They give people the wrong impression that we only believe in peace on the surface level.\n\nThus does the call for a more specialized military police force to  be formed, thus borne the Peacekeepers. These dedicated law enforcement teams are armed with an extra layer of protection for their DT-41 Combat Armor and are issued a Nano Riot Shield that can be used to deflect incoming attacks while the Peacekeepers close in to subdue their targets with shock guns and Law Batons.\n\nThe Delta Forces initially believed that the Peacekeepers are nothing more than policies armed with weaker weapons for use in civilian zone, but their opinions changed quickly when they discovered that one of their tanks were stopped dead in its tracks after the driver fired the cannon on nearby house thinking it would be a funny meme. A Peacekeeper dashed in, intercept the cannon with her shields and hit the tank with the Law Baton, somehow disabling it entirely and proceed to drop Meme Gas inside the tank.

Each disple have also undergone extreme military training, making them both proficient at using psionics and conventional weapons alike.\n\nDark Disciples are classified into multiple cases depending on their skill levels, starting from Initiate, Acolyte, Templar, Executor and finally Psion. Their powers range from Telekinesis, Pyrokinesis,  Electrokinesis, Psychokinesis, Cyrokinesis, Telepathy, Psionic Shielding, Premonition and in rare cases, Mind Manipulation, Essence Shift or Novakinesis.\n\nThe term "Dark" is a moniker used to distinguish the powers of the Disciples from the Psi Warriors, for the Disciples prefer more direct approach to solutions. A Psi Warrior may use mind control to persuade his victim to surrender, a Disciple simply makes them surrender through their raw psionic powers and combat skills.

At G7, the warriors earn the right to become a Gene Commando. The difficulty of these missions is so infamous that even passing into G1 alone is considered an impressive feat.\n\nOnce fully inducted as Gene Commandos, the warriors are further augmented and enhanced with genetic traits that make them appear as gods amongst men.

Each commando's ability to bear the gifts depend on their natural affinity to the master trait. To prevent accidental mutations, the commando must be thoroughly tested for compatibility before any supernatural traits may be granted to them.\n\nRumors that Gene Commandos can develop psionic powers or that they can move a planet by repeatedly stomping on the ground have proven to be just that, rumors and there is no evidence that such things are ever possible."

acot_precursor_databank.6.a.synthper: "§ESynthetic or Delphic?§!\n\nSCS-900 are true synthetic soldiers who exhibit class-10 intelligence matrix. This gives them nigh unlimited thought capacity and their synthetic natures allow them to utilize various dangerous maneuvers that would have been lethal to even Delta Forces. For example, they are able to utilize both jump jets, blink and jump drives into underwater and quickly back into the air before performing triple 360 spin back into the ground and continue to operate normally with any drops in performance. A regular Delta Trooper would have become too dizzied or confused at such a rapid change in combat configurations.\n\nThey are also able to wield much deadlier weapons than a typical infantry, including even ship-sized armaments.\n\nBut what truly seperates them as unique combat forces is that the SCS-900 does not actually possess any critical weaknesses that would render any of their parts inoperable. A test has been made by firing a Thermal Lance on an SCS-900 without any protection, though he is blown into pieces, all of his parts are still operational and continue to perform their functions and with only a brief repair, is fully reassembled to continue fighting. Another test involve close combat analysis, where 100 soldiers are pitted against an SCS-900, the soldiers are caught in a surprise when the SCS-900 suddenly detach all of his components and turn into 100 different parts each relentlessly attacking and subduing all  the soldiers at once.\n\nDespite this fact, there is one drawback. Being fully synthetic means that the SCS-900 is not immune to fear or self-preservation, and there are reports in which the SCS-900s may disobey their directives against unwinnable odds or if their self-preservation overrides the importance of mission objectivess."

acot_precursor_databank.900.pac.response: "Carriers have arrived. Right, these ones were designed by some weird plant-like precursors called Prothrown, they really love using Carriers apparently. Too bad the only working prototype got shot down by around 12-14 marines armed with gauss rifles on surface of their homeworld Ayer. Not sure how they managed to get a capital ship blown up by ground infantry, but such is the wonders of the Ascension War!"
