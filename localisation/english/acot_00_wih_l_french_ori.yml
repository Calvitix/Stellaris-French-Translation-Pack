acot_war_in_hell.1.b.tooltip: "The Fallen Empire will awake and acquire all advanced technologies that they have somehow never managed to learn for over a million of years while we could do so in a span of a couple years. But at least they won't declare war on us right away."

So hyped by their newfound power that they begin to awaken from their stagnation.\n\nBut we know better, we know the truth of their false pretensions at playing the laughable role of precursors. These old fools are nothing but shadows of the true precursors."
acot_war_in_hell.300.desc.b: "An interesting development within the galactic climate has occurred. Apparently, [FallenEmpireTaskOrigin.GetName] appears to have retrofitted their fleets with new technologies. Scientists are debating on how is this possible, given their massive lack of interests and stagnation.\n\nArmed with this new power, they have began to mobilize their fleets and prepare to reawaken once again."

acot_war_in_hell.200.desc.b: "An interesting development within the galactic climate has occurred. Apparently, someone must have made the [FallenEmpireTaskOrigin.GetName] very very angry, as they have decided to stop being dormant and have once again awakened to reclaim their lost glory."

acot_war_in_hell.400.desc: "[FallenEmpireTaskOrigin.GetName] amasses another armada of their fleets, more and more ships are being added into their deathball.

acot_war_in_hell.16.desc: "Through sheer resolve and will, we have triumphed over our fallen enemies. We have shown the galaxy that the fallen empires are naught but a cob-web of lies. To believe in them is to believe in nothing. The Fallen Empire boasted of unrivalled powers, they were entrusted with the ultimate weapons, the ultimate technologies...and still they failed! So much for the glory of the old!\n\nIn their last moments, they attempted to sabotage and destroy every last pool of knowledge and resources, but our quick actions has managed to thwart most of these attempts, and the boon of resources are now available to us."
acot_war_in_hell.16.a: "To the victor, goes the spoil!"
 
 
acot_war_in_hell.17.desc: "See, you plebeians know nothing of warfare. The fact that you still managed to lose despite having conceived such an advanced technology is a testament to how pathetic you are. Such powers are not meant to be used by weaklings.\n\nTo ensure there will be no further mistakes, all of your leaders will be executed., and all of your technologies will now be ours to command and conquer. Your resources will be drained. Your fleets will be destroyed.\n\nConsider  yourselves lucky, our ancestors would have done much worse."

acot_war_in_hell.18.desc: "It worked! It actually worked! The foolish fallen empire transported our rigged cache of technologies on board their capital and it exploded! KA-BOOM!\n\nReports indicate the entire navy stationed aboard their homeworld has been evaporated and their decrepit homeworld is now a thing but a charred and burnt crisp."
acot_war_in_hell.18.a: "This outcome is inevitable, given their lack of common senses."
acot_war_in_hell.18.b: "They are called fallen empires for a reason."

The Fallen Empire is no more."
acot_war_in_hell.19.desc: "It worked! It actually worked! In fact...it may have worked way too well...\n\nThe idiotic grandpas transported our rigged cache of technologies on board their capital and it exploded and caused a massive chain-reaction that somehow blew up their entire empire. Their decrepit and volatile Dark Matter Reactors must have been too outdated and too old to contain."
