ENIGMATIC_DRIVE_DM: "Delta Translocator Drive"
ENIGMATIC_DRIVE_DM_DESC: "This enigmatic Jump Drive uses dark energy to phase the ship towards new space, allowing the ship to jump farther than conventional jump drive. The process does not rely on traditional dimensional rifts, making it safer than the old Jump Drive."
tech_enigmatic_drive_dm: "Space Translocation"
tech_enigmatic_drive_dm_desc: "Traditional Jump Drives are based on the principles and configurations of Zero-Point Energy, which has the possibility of creating unforseen dimensional cascades. However, it is possible to develop a new FTL techniques that utilizes Dark Energy to "rewrite" the ship into a new location in space."
