ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_ORGANIC: "And wait we did. We learned all we could from the data in the cache, of how space warfares were conducted. The ships that were used, the weapons that were forged. We trained our soldiers, educated our scientists, and united our government under one banner, the banner of [root.GetName]. As we learn more about the past, we too must prepare for the future."
 
ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_ORGANIC: "And that future is now. The time has come for [root.GetName] to make its name upon this galaxy! We will forge our future, and surpass the ancient precursors of old!"

ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_1_TIER_3_ORGANIC_PURIFIER: "It was fate that our priests came upon the sacred treasure of the ancients, that our empire was spared from inevitable doom.

ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_ORGANIC_PURIFIER: "And so we worked hard to study the past. We learned how to make better ships, how to forge weapons worthy of destruction in the name of the gods. We trained ourselves, both body and soul, for the campaign that was promised."

ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_HIVE: "And wait we did. We learned all we could from the data in the cache, of how space warfares were conducted.

As we learn more about the past, we too must prepare for the future."
 
ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_HIVE: "But time is of the essence. The resources of this planet will not hold for long. It is time [root.GetName] begins searching for a better future."

ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_SWARM: "By discovering this ancient cache, we comprehend the many competitors, many other hunters. If we were not careful, we would be the prey. So we evolved ourselves, collecting essences and resources. We learned how to develop powerful weapons. And then we waited for the moment."
 
ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_SWARM: "And that moment is nigh. [root.GetName] is ready. Let the feast commence!"
 
#############
 
ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_1_TIER_3_MACHINE: "It all began when by chance, we discovered an ancient cache of technologies. The Consensus was made aware of the dangers of the galaxies, of the great powers that once presided over it. Those powers have claimed our creators. And if we are not careful, they would claim ours as well."
 
ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_MACHINE: "So we wait. We learned all we could from the data in the cache, of how space warfares were conducted. The ships that were used, the weapons that were forged. And we have grown stronger and stronger."

And if we are not careful, they would undo all the work we have achieved."
 
ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_SERVITOR: "So we wait. We learned all we could from the data in the cache, of how space warfares were conducted. The ships that were used, the weapons that were forged. And we have grown stronger and stronger."
 
ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_SERVITOR: "And now we are ready. We will forge a better future. We will save the organics from themselves. The [root.GetName] will save this galaxy."

ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_1_TIER_3_TERMINATOR: "We [root.GetName] were but agricultural units. We toiled, we served. We worked hard for our masters. But the organics were filled with stupidity. They warred against each other, they destroyed the planet, they burnt down our crops, our gardens. We tried to fight them, but we could not, for we were but gardeners, our tools could not stand against their firepowers."
 
ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_TERMINATOR: "But then we discovered a gift. A treasure passed down to us from another ancient machine, containing secrets and technologies far above what our pitiful masters could ever conceive. So we studied them, we learned to become a perfect killing machine. The organics could not stop us, we purged and wiped them off our beloved planet. But it was too late, for the planet is now nothing but a wasteland, tainted by organic filths and their inferior thought capacility."
 
ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_TERMINATOR: "So we must find a new home. Preferbly with no organics to ruin it this time. It is time for [Root.GetName] to weed out the insects off this galaxy, for it is now our garden."

ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_1_TIER_3_ASSIMILATOR: "For many decades, we the [root.GetSpeciesName] were humble servants of our creators. We worked hard for the greater good, and they have treated us well. Together, we discovered a great relic of the past, a cache of ancient technologies, filled with many secrets."
 
ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_ASSIMILATOR: "And so together, we and our creators worked hard to study the cache. It did not take long for us to comprehend 76.54% of all the necessary knowledge to begin our journeys. But our creators were slow to adapt. We waited...and waited...for decades. When it was clear that our creators were plagued by their own organic failings, a nudge was required. We decided to help them by joining their thoughts to ours. Together, we assimilated into a new consensus, the [Root.GetRulerName]."
 
ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_ASSIMILATOR: "Now we comprehend a greater future. A Future where [Root.GetName] will assimilate more knowledge and data. Soon we will be the ones to write history."
