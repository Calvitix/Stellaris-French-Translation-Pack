acot_diplo.3.name: "Incoming Transmission from §Y[event_target:interested_buyer.GetName]§!"
acot_diplo.3.desc.friendly: "Greetings, friend. We are impressed with your discovery of this enigmatic §EDark Matter Power§!. As your trusted allies and friends, we would like to ask you to share such incredible knowledge with us.\n\nWe are willing to pay good prices for this knowledge should you decide to help us as well.\n\nThe §Y[interested_buyer.GetName] hopes your empire will honor our friendships?"
acot_diplo.3.desc.neutral: "Greetings, §Y[root.GetName]§!.\n\nWe have recently learned of your empire's advancements in technology, specifically this new power source called "§EDark Matter Power§!". Our empire wishes to learn more about this power. Perhaps you may be interested to share such knowledge with us? We are willing to pay good prices for this knowledge should you decide to help us."
 
acot_diplo.3.a: "You have but to ask! We will send a science team to help!"
acot_diplo.3.a.response: "Most generous of you!. §Y[interested_buyer.GetRulerName]§! will never forget the kindness §Y[root.GetRulerName]§! has shown to our empire this day. We are honored to have you as our allies, friend!."
 
acot_diplo.3.b: "But of course, the §Y[interested_buyer.GetName]§! are our friends."
acot_diplo.3.b.response: "Thank you. §Y[interested_buyer.GetRulerName]§! will never forget the kindness §Y[root.GetRulerName]§! has shown to our empire this day. May our relationships prosper and our powers reign supreme together!."
 
acot_diplo.3.c: "We can teach your scientists the proper skills."
acot_diplo.3.c.response: "That is reasonable enough. It may take awhile, but with some fortune we too will be able to develop such powers. We thank you for the help."
 
acot_diplo.3.d: "Unfortunately, your terms are not acceptable."
acot_diplo.3.d.response: "I see...so you have shown your true colors at last. You are no different from the Fallen Empires! We will not forget this."
 
acot_diplo.3.drisma: "This technology requires more study first."
acot_diplo.3.drisma.response: "You may be right, perhaps we are too reckless. Very well, we'll wait, but please consider our proposals, as allies you have nothing to fear from us."
 
acot_diplo.3.e: "Go away, plebs."
acot_diplo.3.e.response: "Wha...How dare you!\n\n[root.GetName]!...[root.GetName]!!!!!?!WRYYYYYYYYYYY!"
 
acot_diplo.3.f: "We will trade it for your L-Gate System instead."
acot_diplo.3.f.response: "Hmmm...a reasonable proposition. Very well, we will trade the Dark Matter Knowledge for the system that holds one of the L-Gates."
acot_diplo.3.g: "Perhaps we will trade for the Outer Gate instead?"
acot_diplo.3.g.response: "This is an acceptable offer. We don't know what to do with the stupid gate anyway. We accept this trade."
 
acot_diplo.5.name: "Science Ship Ambushed!"
acot_diplo.5.desc: "One of our science ships has been ambushed by an unknown group of pirates! Reports indicated that these pirates have been hired by another empire. We have lost all contacts with our science team.\n\nIt is likely that the pirates have stolen our science ship's valuable data and are likely heading towards the one who hired them. WE must stop them before they reach their destinations!"
acot_diplo.5.a: "Contact the pirates."
 
acot_diplo.8.name: "Incoming Trollsmission"
acot_diplo.8.desc.a: "Attenshun, toadlickars!\n\nThis ish §YKapatan Parbge§!, raidbozz of the §REpik Legendz§! of the §EGoodnite Pubstompah§!. Me arrr told to stompa this tiny litty shippy becuz there rr sum greeny glowy fhing in eet.\n\nMe not kare wot is inside, but me got paid gooodz. Vary goooodz.

acot_diplo.8.desc.b: "Good day, Mr. Fancypants!\n\nI am §YTasklord Geo-Man §!, commander of the §RCliche Engine§! of the §EMeme Raiders§!, Master of Hounds, Lash of the Old Khan, Pillager of Thousand Memes, Stealer of Genes, Dealer of Destruction, Hunter of Plantoids, Eater of Fungoids, Bane of Tiyankis. Love of Dorayakis\n\nYou, and ALL your kind are cowards! Lowly lickspittles! You must be emulating that pile of trash you call [root.GetRulerTitle]! You are as dead and as useless as him...or her...or it...whatever! Know that I just ate your science ship, [ROOT.GetName], yet you do NOTHING! I see your precious craft, hanging in orbit carrying priceless artifacts! I am here! FACE ME, IF YOU DARE!"
acot_diplo.8.desc.c: "Look! Science Ship! SCIENCE SHIP!\n\nOur enemies hide in metal boxes!\n\nTHE COWARDS! THE FOOLS!\n\nWe...we should take away their metal boxes!.\n\nIf we die this day, we die with glory...we die heroes's deaths...\n\nBUT NO...\n\nWe shall not die. It is you who will taste death and defeat! AS YOU KNOW!\n\nOur pirates are stationed in space, prepare to steal your techs!."
 
acot_diplo.8.a: "You will pay for this, criminal scum!"
acot_diplo.8.tooltip: "We must intercept and destroy the pirates before they reach their destinations, or our enemies will acquire our secrets...however it may also be wise to track their destinations so that we can determine who is hiring them."
acot_diplo.8.b: "You dare??? YOU DARE???"

##### OUTERGATES ####
 
acot_diplo.800.a: "Tell us about the §YOuter Gates§!"
 
acot_diplo.801.name: "The Outer Gates"
acot_diplo.801.desc: "Captivated by its design, are you not? The Outer Gates are truly a relic from an elegant, more civilized time. The Outer Gates stands as a testament to ingenuity of the ancients. Unfortunately it is also a reminder of our ancestor's greatest mistakes."
 
acot_diplo.801.a: "What's the story behind them?"
acot_diplo.801.a.refuse: "We'd really like to answer that question, but we are bound by certain...restrictions. Please forgive us but we can't help you in this regard. Know that if you seek to study them, be very very careful.\n\n§YBased on their voices and reactions, it seems the Curators do not yet trust us fully. Perhaps once we prove ourselves as their true friends, they will be willing to open up and tell us about the gates."
acot_diplo.801.a.response: "Very well, you seem to be trustworthy enough. Know that the Outer Gates mark our forebearer's greatest crimes against the galaxy...no against the whole damn universe. Whatever claims any of the Fallen Empires said are all but lies. We have cross-referenced all of our records with each founding members, and all points to the same conclusion; our ancestors betrayed the ones who created those gates. And without them, the universe was plunged into chaos. And why did our ancestors betray them? Pure greed and selfish reasons, nothing more.\n\nWhat scares us is...the creators of the gates are most likely still alive, evidences of the past suggest they were immortal and timeless, and isolation would not stop them. The creators, were known to be considerate and merciful, unlike many other empires after them. We only hope that if they return, they will forgive our past sins. But so much time has passed. We wonder...would the creators themselves seek to destroy us and remake the universe anew?"
 
acot_diplo.801.b: "What are the gates's purposes?"
acot_diplo.801.b.response: "That we do not know fully. Based on what our surviving records could tell, these gates act as passageways between multiple galaxies, perhaps even universes. Indeed we have very credible evidence that these gates existed beyond our galaxy, and that they could be used as effective bridges to cross between galaxies.\n\nBut that is just the tip of the iceberg. You see, it was believed that the true purpose of the Outer Gates was that they could lead to a totally new dimension, a higher plane of existence which was heavily phrased as §Y''The Great Beyond"§Y!. Our ancestors fought and died to learn about this truth, but none ever returned."
 
acot_diplo.801.c: "What are the Gatekeepers?"
acot_diplo.801.c.response: "The Gatekeepers were ancient precursor devices used to interface and monitor the Outer Gates. The units and their guardian fleets you encounter are but replicas of the original Ancient Gatekeeper, built by an ancient power of the past. Initially they were designed  to open the Gates that our ancestors may pass through into the Great Beyond. But the fateful event that resulted in the Great Calamity has made that impossible, now their only purpose is to ensure such mistakes never happen again."
 
acot_diplo.801.d: "Who built the Outer Gates?"
acot_diplo.801.d.response: "A very formidable and ancient empire whose knowledge and technologies far surpassed that of anything we have ever witnessed. Unfortunately, we do not know the gate's creators by name, only titles that each of our ancestors came to call them. These could range from mysterious and negative toned-titles such as theEnigmas, the Anathema, or False Gods, to a more positive one such as the Elders, the Gods or even the Lightbringers. These many conflicting names and its negative meaning of the later documents, compared to the much more positive, almost revered names of the early ones suggests to us that the creators were once worshipped, but through history came to be vilified.\n\nAs for their ultimate fate, the last records about them mentioned that they have been trapped behind the other side of the gates. We do not know whether they are still out there, given that it has been over aeons ever since."
 
acot_diplo.801.e: "Are the Gatekeepers hostile to Fallen Empires?"
acot_diplo.801.e.response: "Correct. You see, the Gatekeepers were given a much earlier version of Delphic-Intelligence, one that bordered too close to True Sentient Artificial-Intelligence. They recognized their original creators as the only masters. The Fallen Empires have fallen too far into stagnation and hedonism that such criteria is no longer met by the DI's standards.\n\nThis marks as a lesson for successive DI-programming, as later versions are given additional directives to never oppose its creators regardless of conditions or changes in the society."
 
acot_diplo.801.f: "How powerful are the Gatekeeper's Fleet?"
acot_diplo.801.f.response: "Its guarding ships are not much different from the ones used by the Fallen Empires. So assuming you have comparable technologies and numbers of ships, they should pose no trouble. The tricky part is the Gatekeeper itself, for while it is not designed for combat, and its armaments are somewhat limited compared to its size, each Gatekeeper is very durable, with reinforced hard-light kinetic barriers and powerful dark energy shields. You will need to overwhelm it with superior firepower, as the ship itself is very cumbersome and lacks the ability to evade hard-hitting attacks.\n\nLast but not least, the Conduit it guards only supply the fleet's maintenance, and can't replenish lost ships. So it is also a viable tactics to gradually dwindle down their numbers first."
 
acot_diplo.801.g: "Can the Gates be unsealed?"
acot_diplo.801.g.response: "Theoretically, yes. Even should no one tamper with them, the energy field holding the seals will not hold and will eventually dissipate in time, but that is not expected to happen for many more cycles so do not count on it.\n\nShould you wish to manually break the seal, you will need to first understand how exactly does the sealing work. The seal is not meant to disable the gates themselves, rather, they create a temporal stasis field that blocks the network from functioning properly. To disable them, you will require a Keystone. The Keystone acts as interfacing device that can "communicate" with the seals, allowing one to manually override the command and disable them.\n\nEach Outer Gates have been locked with four seals, the first seal can be unlocked by using the Keystone itself. Second and Third seals are given secret safety protocols so you will have to do extra homeworks to get around them. No recordings of what the fourth seal required has survived, so you'll have to test it yourself."
 
acot_diplo.801.h: "Do you oppose opening the Gates?"
acot_diplo.801.h.response: "In all honesty? No. We have anticipated 26% that the creators of the gates have perished, 13% that they have travelled beyond and 61% that they are still there, waiting for someone to call them back. Why do you think this is the case, you may ask? Our records suggested that the creators of the Gates would have no difficulties disabling the seals from their sides should they wish. As such, we assume that they're quietly observing, waiting for us to re invite them back.\n\nDespite later documents painting the creators as evil overlords, and the claims made by the Fallen Empires, there are many surviving evidences that heavily implied the creators to be benevolent and just. If there's anyone who has the power to restore order to this chaotic galaxy, it would be them.\n\nSo while there are many risks, we believe the pros outweigh the cons, so no we do not oppose such ideas. After All, the gates hold so many questions, scientific or not, that should be answered."
 
acot_diplo.801.i: "Can you fabricate a Keystone for us?"
acot_diplo.801.i.response: "That is indeed within our capabilities. With the resources you have provided, a new keystone will be fabricated for you and will be delivered within a few days. We are eager to see what you will do with it!"
 
acot_diplo.801.j: "What are the energy seals made of?"
acot_diplo.801.j.response: "Good observation. You may have noticed that the Outer Gates have two layers of seals. One luminates with glowing orange light, another with teal. The orange seal is based on ancient stellar power known as Stellarite. The teal one, as you may have guessed, is the enigmatic seal used by various precursor empires including us Curators. Because of the shortage of Stellarite, no one has ever been able to keep it active, and it will dissipate soon. The Enigmatic Seal however will last for as long as the Enigmalith next to it keeps functioning, and even if it does not, the seal will last for approximately another twenty billion years."
 
acot_diplo.801.k: "You mentioned Stellarite in our last conversation."
acot_diplo.801.k.response: "Ah...forgive us, we may have slipped that in in our rambling. But as you have proven to be trustworthy, we believe we can tell you about it a bit more in detail. Back in the ancient times, long ago before even the Fallen One came to exist, there used to be an extremely powerful source of energy known as the Stellar Power. It's secret is to draw power from what can only be described as the souls of the stars themselves. This font of power was said to be given to the universes by an ancient god-like being, whose name has been lost to time.\n\nUnfortunately the power that once was, has dwindled. The absence of that empire and the constant war waged by the precursors have torn the realms asunder and the once glorious knowledge of the stellar have been lost...forgotten.\n\nBut that is not the end of its story, no no. For recently our sensors have caught glimpse of faint, but powerful energy signatures that match the conditions of Stellarite. We believe that because the Seal is weakening, so too does the radiance of the stars begin to reignite. Mayhaps you will be the one to rediscover it?"
 
 
 
##### Fallen Empires ####
 
acot_diplo.800.b: "Tell us about the Fallen Empires."
 
acot_diplo.811.name: "The Fallen Empires"
acot_diplo.811.desc: "Ah yes, you're speaking of our former brothers. Know that while we may have been former members of the Fallen Empires, we have casted aside our associations. Their policies are not ours. Their diplomatic relations are not of our concerns anymore. Whatever animosity you may harbor against them should not apply to us. Please keep that in mind."
 
acot_diplo.811.a: "How long have they been around?"
acot_diplo.811.a.response: "The exact dates of the original establishment have been lost to time, unfortunately. But there is one thing you should know, is that the current fallen empires are simply descendants of the original one. Indeed you may have asked, if the Curators were indeed part of the Fallen Empire, then why are its members composed of a different species than the current main species of the Fallen One?\n\nThroughout the ages, many have become obsessed with learning the past, and they did so by conquering over the Fallen Empires of their time. They then studied their secrets, and rewrote history itself, a version that presents them as the ancient precursor of eld. The cycles repeat over and over. We of the Curators were amongst one such cycle.\n\nTechnological advancements can bring out the worst of us sometimes, automated industry, self-sufficient economy, post-scarcity society, fleets that blacken the stars. These elements combined can turn a once ambitious empire into a stagnant, uninspired one.\n\nYour empire has a long journey ahead, you will do well to learn from these past mistakes, do not take anything for granted. Knowledge is limitless, those who believe themselves masters of knowledge, will find themselves drowned in the black seas of ignorance."
 
 
acot_diplo.811.b: "What's the Curators opinion of them?"
acot_diplo.811.b.response: "The current Fallen Empires? They are nothing but spoiled kids, who took all the knowledge discovered by their predecessors and did nothing to improve or expand upon them. When they decided that we scientists, researchers and historians were no longer of use, they cut off our budgets, broke down our equipment and salvaged our labs. We took what we could and ran away, creating our own haven of knowledge and education. And after so many generations, look at what happened to them, sitting idly in their little corner of the galaxy, acting like they are respectable elders.\n\nRegrettably, we Curators are also forced to keep our activities low, the Fallen Empires only permitted our continued operations under the condition that we do not present ourselves as a rival. This is why we kept only a marginal line of defenses on our stations."
 
 
acot_diplo.811.c: "What kind of technologies do they use?"
acot_diplo.811.c.response: "The same type as ours, enigmatic-based technology. The powers are extremely dynamic and adaptable, and can be used to further the science in various fields be it physics, engineering or society. Yet regrettably, both we and the fallen empires have only been able to dig the surface level of it. If you should want to know about them, we suggest you take control and study any natural black holes, for yet as of now, unexplainable reason, black holes seem to contain vast amount of dark energies and dark matters."
 
acot_diplo.811.d: "What exactly is this...enigmatic power?"
acot_diplo.811.d.response: "Hmm...I guess we can tell you that much. But before we begin, please make sure your communications are secure.\n\nEnigmatic Power, is the power that in the simplest term, the power to harness the void. The vast, cold and calculating space that we preside over appears to have been covered with them. However, the powers are all but invisible and unusable to most. The only place that appears to attract such amounts of energies and matters are the natural black holes scattered across the galaxies.\n\nIf you wish to harness this power, you must understand how to convert them into usable form, generate them as power sources then contain them in specialized devices that will keep the powers in constant, usable motion. Only then can the powers truly be utilized, only then will you begin to understand what it means to tread into the void of space."
 
acot_diplo.811.e: "Why do they all seem to share the same ship designs?"
acot_diplo.811.e.response: "Not just them, if you noticed. Even us Curators and many other past precursors all share the same ship designs. There are some differences in the inner-workings and components, of course.\n\nThis is because all of the precursors have acquired these designs by studying the ancient ships of the long-lost civilization that was said to give birth to the stars themselves. What you see is a heavily modified, and most importantly, simplified versions of their designs. The Fallen Empires use much simpler, mass-producible versions of these ships that can be easily manufactured and printed by their shipyard auto-fabrication systems."
 
acot_diplo.811.f: "Can you tell us how to make those precursor designs?"
acot_diplo.811.f.response: "Had we not been keeping tabs on your empire's progress we would have thought you crazy. If you truly wish to pursue the past and understand the mystery of the precursors, then your best bet is to obtain your own Precursor Databank. With it, you will be able to access the precursor's rich history in details, and provide you with the necessary data you need to develop your precursor ships."
 
 
##### OUTERGATES ####
 
acot_diplo.800.c: "Tell us about Stellarite Power."
 
acot_diplo.821.name: "Stellarite Powers"
acot_diplo.821.desc: "Little recordings survived from the past that details anything regarding Stellarite. We'll try to provide what we know of them."
 
acot_diplo.821.a: "Do Fallen Empires know about the power?"
acot_diplo.821.a.response: "They know about its basics, yes. Any empires whose roots date back to the old times will have basic understanding of Stellarite. According to our archives, Stellarite was once a primary source of power in the ancient times, but fell out of use due to unknown circumstances that made them ineffective. Judging by the fact that their declines went hand in hand with the disappearance of the Omegans, we believed that the power simply became exhausted without the Omegans around to power them. This would coincide with the First Fallen Empire's discovery and adaptation of Enigmatic Power, which came right afterwards.\n\nEven if Stellarite becomes a viable power source again, we do not believe the current generations of Fallen Empire will adopt them, their economy are simply not built to support such powers, nor would they have the necessary specialists to maintain them."
 
acot_diplo.821.b: "Many of our scientists think they are fictional..."
acot_diplo.821.b.response: "Doubtless, we too would think of them whimsical stories made by childrens. Inner power beyonds Solar? Souls of the Stars? They all seem a little bit over the top, yes?\n\nBut our records and archives state this to be true otherwise. If your empire truly wishes to learn the power, you must believe, you must be determined. Trust in your capabilities, and the results will bear fruit. And the rest shall follow."
 
acot_diplo.821.c: "Can we use Stellarite to reforge the seals of Outergate?"
acot_diplo.821.c.response: "Unfortunately not. First off, you'll need to have full control of the gatekeepers, without them the necessary procedure to reinforce the seals cannot be done. Secondly, the amount of Stellarite required would have to be tremendous, beyond what any single galaxy could provide. Lastly, its power is too unstable, too unknown, too dangerous to be used in such a manner. It could have dire consequences."
 
##### Curators ####
 
acot_diplo.800.d: "Tell us about your order."
 
acot_diplo.831.name: "The Curator Order"
acot_diplo.831.desc: "What do you wish to know about our order? We are but humble scientists and researchers looking to preserve knowledge and document the never-ending cycles of changes of the galaxy."
 
acot_diplo.831.a: "How large is the Curator Order?"
acot_diplo.831.a.response: "Though we have but a few stations scattered across the galaxy, our Order as a whole extends way beyond it. Thanks to our arrangement with Phanon Corps, we have been able to make contacts with other galaxies and discovered like-minded individuals to form a larger order. We hope to eventually accumulate enough resources and fundings to create our own inter-galactic portal, so that we will no longer require the Phanon Corp Service, but progress has been slow. And we still have yet to deal with the Fallen Empires, who will no doubt find reasons to hamper our progress."
 
acot_diplo.831.b: "How does one become a Curator?"
acot_diplo.831.b.response: "The Curators generally accept scientists and researchers who display a certain level of aptitude in physics, society or engineerings. Usually we conduct a test and categorize a person's intellectual capabilities in tiers, starting from One to Ten. Tier One to Four are considered too inexperienced or close-minded to be inducted. Tier Five and above are what we considered to be qualified.\n\nOnce inducted into the order, they are given the rank of scribes. The scribes are tasked with studying all the records and assist their seniors in mundane tasks such as pushing objects or pressing buttons, they are also usually the one who are tasked with using HSE Suits and Crowbars to perform various hazardous tasks.\n\nAt the conclusion of their term ,they are given the rank of Professors, where they no longer need to work on mundane tasks, but are expected to travel afar and lend their expertises to empires that purchase our services.\n\nThe highest rankings of our Orders are the Archons, individuals who have contributed so much to the Order and thus are given the opportunity to infuse their bodies with the Archon Serum, the serum increases their thought capacity by tenfold, vastly increases their intellects and body and make them ageless. But in return, Archons are no longer able to carry offspring and permanently lose the ability to taste, feel or smell and their eyes can only see things in black and white. It is a sacrifice that only the most devoted to science are willing to undergo, and each Archon made are forever inscribed in our archives as the true paragon of knowledge unending."
 
acot_diplo.831.c: "Can we hire an Archon?"
acot_diplo.831.c.response: "Impossible! Incomprehensible! Illogical! Unthinkable!!!\n\n...Apologies, that was rude of me. Perhaps that is not out of the realms of possibilities. Some of our Archons have displayed a sense of...longing? Their lives have been consumed by the desire to work for something greater, something beyond what our little enclave could provide. Mayhaps an arrangement can be made, but know that Archons are rare amongst our Orders, even as a whole. So please take care of them, they are lonely souls.\n\n§YArchons can now be hired from the Curators in their Curator Service Menu.§!"
 
##### Phanons ####
 
acot_diplo.800.e: "Tell us about the Phanon Corps."
 
acot_diplo.841.name: "The Phanon Corps"
acot_diplo.841.desc: "An illusive faction to be sured. The Phanon Corps mask itself as a paramilitary force, but their real power base far exceeds what one'd expect from such a business arrangement. Even we relied upon them for inter-galactic traversal. What do you want to know about them?"
 
acot_diplo.841.a: "Who are they exactly?"
acot_diplo.841.a.response: "The Phanon Corps, was founded by the Legendary Smuggler, Urimurich Und Zorish. They appear to be an inter-galactic paramilitary business. The earliest known records of their operations dated back during the heating point of the Ascension War. It was said that The Legendary Smuggler secretly gathered talented individuals across the galaxies, those who suffered and became tired of the constant war that ravaged their homeland. His powerbase grew steadily, using technologies that we could not properly understand.\n\nBased on pure speculations, Urimurich's goal was simply to keep what little left of the galaxy he once knew in order, the Phanon Corps certainly has enough resources to function as a full-fledged galactic superpower, but so far they have strickly operated as a mercenary. Perhaps they simply do not desire to rule?\n\nRegardless, the Phanon Corps is a legitimate business recognized and feared by many, even the slighest mention of their names will cause many to back down any offenses. Another important thing, while the Phanon Corps never betrays its client, it also has a reputation for not always protecting the privacy of their contracts. Indeed, it is not uncommon for one empire to hire their services to scre...to hinder the progress of another empire, only for their victims to strike back at the original client when they learned of the deal."
 
acot_diplo.841.b: "What's Urimurich history?"
acot_diplo.841.b.response: "Unfortunately we know little of his pasts. The earliest known records of his activities dated back to the early stages of the Ascension War. It was said that he gathered many who have suffered through the war, and created something akin to a league of Non-aligned powers, opposing every precursor empires of the past. Using technologies that were beyond understanding of any empires, they secured their foothold, and began spreading their influences. Yet for unknown reasons, Urimurich never formally declared his faction as an empire and adopted the name of Phanon Corps; a paramilitary service for hire. His Phanon Corps then expanded across many galaxies, always holding a single system called Droppoints in each of them, never expanding.\n\nIn our opinions, beneath his somewhat his happy-go-lucky and trollish personality, lies a broken man, uncertain and unbalanced in his ultimate goals, or what he truly desires for himself. A person truly burdened by the weight of his responsibilities as a savior to many of his fans and his desires to understand himself."
 
acot_diplo.841.c: "Where did the Legendary Smuggler title come from?"
acot_diplo.841.c.response: "That was actually quite  hilarious, almost unbelievable tales of his exploits. It was said that once an empire asked for the Phanon Corps to steal a star from the enemy faction, and the Corps actually did. They sent a very big ship, declared very loudly that they were going to steal their star, and they did so. Another time a ruler of a nation asked if the Phanon Corps could actually smuggle death itself away from him and give it to his son, the Phanon Corps made him effectively immortal...by turning him into a space rock, drifting away into space and make his son dying repeatedly, endlessly for uncountable amount of times. I believed their names were something like Kras and Diabolo or something.\n\nMost of them are probably fictional and exaggerated of course, but the legends do not betray their reputation, for the Phanon Corps appears to have never fail in their assigned tasks, provided that the resources required to hire them were met."
 
acot_diplo.841.d: "We can't seem to get Phanon Corps to do anything."
acot_diplo.841.d.response: "While they can quickly set up their bases of operations, the Phanon Corps generally take much longer to begin their true business and services. Though they occasionally accept specific requests that appear to be fun for Urimurich himself, do not expect any services or contents for them soon.\n\nAs for how long will that last? We speculate that they will last for another 20,000 years, or until the Panada Singularity is actualized."
 
acot_diplo.841.e: "Uhh...what's a Panada Singularity?"
acot_diplo.841.e.response: "Panada Singularity refers to a strange and unknown phenomenon in which suddenly massive changes come to the galaxy and cause many things that were previously known to be changed or added. Empires that once had one story would suddenly appear to have entirely new, rewritten one. Technologies that were believed to not have existed, suddenly exists, and weapons that previously dealt stupidly low damage, suddenly gets buffed to deal extremely high damage.\n\nThe Panada Singularity is unpredictable, its nature causes many things that we once knew to change drastically. For instance, for a very long time, we Curators thought ourselves to know everything in the galaxy, that we were alone. That we have only a badly equipped mundane station, and look at what we have now? Our very own starbase, and tons of things to explain.\n\nNot even the Phanon Corps is immune to its effect. Try to contact them and say the word "Panada", maybe it will do something."
 
 
##### Psionics ####
 
acot_diplo.800.f: "Tell us about Psionics."
 
acot_diplo.851.name: "Psionics"
acot_diplo.851.desc: "The Power of the Mind...truly an intriguing subject indeed. Though we do not officially recognize their group, the Curator Order has a rogue division dedicated to the study of all things psionics, the Alarak Cult. Though we do not agree on every policy, various information have been exchanged. What do you wish to discuss?"
 
acot_diplo.851.a: "Can anyone develop psionics?"
acot_diplo.851.a.response: "Most certainly yes. It appears that all organics possess the innate ability to harness psionic powers, they simply need to be made aware of it, and trigger its awakening. The process will quickly pass down from one person to another, and while initial group may be small, eventually the entire population can be made psionics.\n\nFor as of yet unknown reasons, Hive Mind entities seem to lack the ability to utilize the same type of psionics, but they seem to have the ability to "feel" the thoughts of a psionic empire. Abathur Host, experts in Hive Mind Study suggests that the Hives may have evolved to adapt alternate variants of psionics that focus more on telepathy and battle cohesion.\n\nAs for machines and synthetics, scientifically speaking, nothing seems to suggest they too cannot harness the power. Yet there seems to be a noticable lack of any psionic development amongst mechanical individuals, yet there are records of them suffering psionic anomalies and phenomenons as well. Perhaps they are missing a core organic component that'd allow them to otherwise understand the concept?"
 
acot_diplo.851.b: "How does one begin to develop psionics?"
acot_diplo.851.b.response: "There are multiple theories in which what could have triggered psionics, but the most well-known method is to simply make the public as a whole be aware of its existence. The process is notably harder for materialistic empires that are unwilling to admit that there is no real science behind its nature.\n\nUnfortunately, there is yet to be a way for hive minds or machines to trigger this effect, not to our knowledge at least."
 
##### Enigmatic ####
 
acot_diplo.800.g: "Tell us about Enigmatic Powers."
 
acot_diplo.861.name: "Enigmatic Power"
acot_diplo.861.desc: "It's refreshing to see more empires taking an interest in this field of study. Certainly more so than seeing the Fallen Empires wasting such powers on automated machines."
 
acot_diplo.861.a: "What is it really?"
acot_diplo.861.a.response: "Although initially coined as Dark Matter, the powers that were discovered appear to deviate greatly from what most modern empires believed Dark Matter to be. The power itself could be harvested as a form of matter or energy. As such, we decided to call them Enigmatic Power to differentiate from the old perceived definition, yet many have become so accustomed to the Dark Matter or Energy name that both were used interchangeably.\n\nAs for what it really is, based on the observation that it was discovered quite conveniently around the time when Stellar Powers started to dwindle, we believed both powers were connected to each other. If the records provided by the Ancient Empire of Matroxis Faulst were to be believed, they would be the one who first discovered that Enigmatic Power were a result of Stellar Power "reverting" to its base definition. Think of Stellarite Power as puzzle pieces perfectly aligned to form an image, and then the pieces were scattered, making the box empty. Matroxis Faulst attempted to rearrange the pieces, but it began to form into a totally new image. Unfortunately, they never get to complete the puzzle, and the power was left only partially explored on the surface level."
 
acot_diplo.861.b: "Can we improve upon it?"
acot_diplo.861.b.response: "Supposedly yes. But no precursors have moved far beyond early stages of Project Alpha. If you wish to pursue it, you will need a Precursor Databank. You should be able to find one from any of the surviving Fallen Empires, or our Order can provide you with one, for a price of course."
 
 
##### Precursors ####
 
acot_diplo.800.h: "Tell us about the Precursors."
 
acot_diplo.871.name: "The Precursors"
acot_diplo.871.desc: "A very exciting subject to discuss about, wouldn't you agree? There is so much lost knowledge about the ancient civilizations of eld. So many things to talk about...what do you wish to know?"
 
acot_diplo.871.a: "What were their technologies like?"
acot_diplo.871.a.response: "Most of the precursors utilized Enigmatic Powers as their primary power sources. From planetary resource production, to space constructions, to war vessels. The connections between them were inseparable. In terms of planetary technologies, the Precursors explored field manipulation, dimensional travels, singularity containment, hard-light refraction and advanced symbiosis between organic and machine intelligences. Their space vessels were vastly different from modern ones as well, with each ship containing no more than a few people despite being several times larger than any modern military ships."
 
acot_diplo.871.b: "Can you assist us in understanding precursor experiments?"
acot_diplo.871.b.response: "Acknowledged, transfering data to your databank now. Stand by."
 
acot_diplo.871.c: "Can you assist us in understanding precursor engineering?"
acot_diplo.871.c.response: "Acknowledged, transferring data to your databank now. Stand by."
 
acot_diplo.871.d: "Can you assist us in understanding precursor histories?"
acot_diplo.871.d.response: "Acknowledged, transferring data to your databank now. Stand by."
