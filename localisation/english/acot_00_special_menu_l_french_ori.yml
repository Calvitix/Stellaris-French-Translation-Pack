acot_special_menu.3.title: "Revitalization Chambers"
acot_special_menu.3.desc: "Faster. Meaner. Better. Stronger."
acot_special_menu.3.1.name: "Remove negative traits of biological leaders."
acot_special_menu.3.1.explain: "This process will remove all stupid and useless traits that hamper the abilities of our leaders to operate at optimal performance and then replace those dumb traits with the positive one.\n\n§YOnly supports vanilla negative traits at the moment.§!"
not_has_shitty_leaders: "We don't have any leaders who are stupid at the moment, we need to wait for someone to show signs of mental sickness first"
 
acot_special_menu.3.2.name: "Bionic Interface Simulation Protocol."
acot_special_menu.3.2.explain: "This process will immediately grant all biological leaders §Y2500§! worth of experiences. Any biological scientists who are at least level 6 will also gain §YSpark of Genius§! traits."
too_soon_to_do_that_nub: "Bionic Interface Simulation puts a lot of strain on our leaders. Once initiated, they will need sometimes to rest before the process can be done again"

acot_special_menu.4.desc: "Intelligent but not artificial."
acot_special_menu.4.1.name: "Remove negative traits off mechanical leaders."
acot_special_menu.4.1.explain: "This process will remove all stupid and useless malfunctions that hamper the abilities of our leaders to operate at optimal performance and then replace those dumb traits with the positive one.\n\n§YOnly supports vanilla negative traits at the moment.§!"
not_has_shitty_leaders_machine: "We don't have any leaders who are terrible at the moment, we need to wait for someone to show signs of corruption first"
 
 
acot_special_menu.4.2.a: "Enable Immortality Protocol"
acot_special_menu.4.2.a.tooltip: "While the protocol is active, our mechanical leaders will have their memories preserved and  will be revived upon their termination. This will heavily increase their upkeep cost and drain our influences however.\n\nBe aware that the system cannot identify whether the leader is destroyed or simply dismissed from service. The protocol will fire regardless."
acot_special_menu.4.2.b: "Disable Immortality Protocol"
acot_special_menu.4.2.b.tooltip: "Our leaders will perform their functions until they are terminated. Then we replace it with a new one. Not everything is meant to last forever."

acot_special_menu.50.title: "Immortality Protocol Engaged"
acot_special_menu.50.desc: "One of our leaders, [From.GetName] has been terminated. But the Immortality Protocol is in effect and will be able to rebuild [From.GetName] back.\n\nHowever, the system cannot classify whether [From.GetName] has been destroyed, or simply dismissed for being incompentent.\n\nShall we revive this leader?"
acot_special_menu.50.a: "Affirmative, we will rebuild [From.GetName], we have the technology."
acot_special_menu.50.a.explain: "Will revive the leader. Do not use this on a dismissed leader."
acot_special_menu.50.b: "Negative, [From.GetName] is annoying and useless to us, we will just get a better model."
