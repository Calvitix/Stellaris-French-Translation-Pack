stellarite_events.1.name: "Stellarite? What Stellarite???"
stellarite_events.1.desc: "We have an interesting situation. Apparently, some of our scientists claimed to have discovered a new type of power source after spending a period of time scanning the energy signature with our advanced enigmatic sensors. These scientists claim that the power of stars can be turned into a power source that is more advanced than even Dark Matter.\n\nWe cannot yet verify the truth of this claim, as this seems to be related to solar power...which we have known even before our empires are capable of space-travel."
stellarite_events.1.a: "Interesting, we should explore this."
stellarite_events.1.b: "Solar power is known for hundred of years, stupid fool."
 
RESEARCH_STELLARITE_POWER: "The Star Beckons"
RESEARCH_STELLARITE_POWER_DESC: "Scientists from all across our empire will gather to debate and experiments on the truth of this new power source. It will take a considerable amount of time before such a bold claim can be verified. There are many possible risks as well, this will not be easy."
 
RESEARCH_STELLARITE_POWER_AGAIN: "The Second Sun"
RESEARCH_STELLARITE_POWER_AGAIN_DESC: "Some of our scientists still believe there is a level of possibility within this new power source. A second convention is to be held to explore further, but this will take a painfully long amount of time."
 
RESEARCH_STELLARITE_COMPONENTS: "Sons of Sun"
RESEARCH_STELLARITE_COMPONENTS_DESC: "We are still exploring all the possible combat applications of the new Stellarite Power. It will take a fair amount of time to come up with the design blueprints for our selected fields."
 
RESEARCH_STELLARITE_COPY: "Following the Trend"
RESEARCH_STELLARITE_COPY_DESC: "Someone just discovered new toys, so naturally the best course of action is to steal them for our own benefits. Mwa ha ha ha ha."
 
stellarite_events.2.name: "The Stellar"
stellarite_events.2.desc: "It is confirmed! After several failed experiments, the team has completed a rough test of this Stellarite power. The power does indeed exist, and can be used as a power source. But we do not yet have a working prototype that can be used for military applications. We must dig deeper."
stellarite_events.2.desc.stellaritegate: "The records within the Gate heavily suggest the existence of Stellarite Power, which proves that this power did exist in the past. But we do not yet have a working prototype that can be used for military applications. We must dig deeper."
stellarite_events.2.tooltip: "Although it is now accepted that Stellarite is a potential power source, we still cannot create a reliably way to contain such powerful energy, we will need a highly skilled scientist in the physics departments to do this.\n\n§YThe scientist in question must be level 10, and have either Curator, Spark of Genius, Erudite, Chosen One, Sapient AI Assistant, Brainbug or Particles Expertise."
 
 
stellarite_events.3.name: "Project Leader Candidate"
stellarite_events.3.desc: "We must select one of our scientists to lead the overall project. This is an area we are not familiar with, and there may be many risks involved. So it is best that the selected candidate have some respectable resume.\n\nSome of our leaders object that it may also be unwise to risk valuable scientists to such untold dangers. WE must choose."
 
stellarite_events.4.name: "Critical Mission Failure"
stellarite_events.4.desc.a: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry! One of the scientists, growing too desperate with the lack of progress, tried to perform the experiment without proper supervision.\n\nThe secret lab exploded, and all teams, including the supervisor are reported dead."
stellarite_events.4.desc.b: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry! The team tried to increase the power output of the solar reactor, but seemed to be too much, and the lab exploded, killing everyone."
stellarite_events.4.desc.c: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry! Someone brought in green apples into the lab, and it caused a massive anomaly that resulted in the apple exploding, which killed all of the team."
stellarite_events.4.desc.d: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry! A sample was inserted into the Anti-Mass Spectrometers, and it caused the equipment to go critical. Bunch of weird aliens teleported in and killed everyone, the lab then exploded shortly afterwards, killing the team and the weird aliens"
stellarite_events.4.desc.e: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry! An unknown saboteur has set us up the bomb. Our team had no chance to survive, made their time. The lab exploded and all our bases are belong to none."
stellarite_events.4.desc.f: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry! Just as when things are going smoothly. One of the scientists lashed out in anger when he realized that the upcoming game he was so hyped about will be exclusive to Epoch Games. He smashed the terminal in anger, and accidently set the whole lab to explode."
stellarite_events.4.desc.g: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry! The Supervisor and some of the teams were on an elevator when it suddenly malfunctioned due to power shortage. The elevator exploded, and destroyed the entire lab."
stellarite_events.4.desc.h: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry! A lab monkey was set free, and it ate all the scientists before jumping into the test chamber and caused everything to explode."
stellarite_events.4.desc.i: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry! The team tried to use an outdated engine in the hopes that all of this will just work. But nope, this did not work. The lab exploded and everyone is now reduced to ashes."
 
 
stellarite_events.4.a: "This cannot be! We must try again!"
stellarite_events.4.b: "What a waste of our time and energy."
 
  
stellarite_events.5.name: "Power Overwhelming!"
stellarite_events.5.desc: "It is done! We have finished developing the mass-producible version of the Stellarite Reactor. With this new invention comes multiple future endaevors for various combat applications, we should begin exploring them without delay!."

stellarite_events.8.name: "Weapons After Tomorrow"
stellarite_events.8.desc: "We have finished finalizing the new schematics for our new stellarite technologies and all related products are ready for mass-production and field testing."
stellarite_events.8.a: "Excelsior!"
 
stellarite_events.9.name: "Days after Yesterday"
stellarite_events.9.desc: "We have received reports that there is a new type of power being used called Solarite or Sailor Rite or something...reports are quite unreliable. But it seems quite remarkable. It will be a waste to let them have those techs alone. We should replicate their designs, afterall..."
stellarite_events.9.a: ""What's yours is mine, and what's mine is also mine."
 
stellarite_events.10.name: "Stellarite Anomaly Detected!"
stellarite_events.10.desc: "Alert! Unstable anomaly detected. It seems our reckless and greedy use of Stellarite Technology has caused a very weird stellarite-based being to begin forming up on one of our systems. We can stop it by dispersing our stellarite stockpile.."
stellarite_events.10.a.desc: "Alert! Unstable anomaly detected. Another Stellarite creature is beginning to emerge. It wishes to turn us into a pizza and claims that it will come back so long as we exist. We must stop existing for it to stop appearing."
stellarite_events.10.a: "Fine, we have no time to waste on them."
stellarite_events.10.b: "No can do, we need those stellarites."
stellarite_events.10.c: "Feed it with more stellarite!." 
stellarite_events.10.c.tooltip: "Are you sure this is a good idea?" 

stellarite_events.1000.name: "Stellarwyrm Defeated!"
stellarite_events.1000.desc.a: "We have defeated the great Stellarwyrm! Upon it's death, massive shower of stellarite energies could he harvested!"
stellarite_events.1000.desc.b: "Our investment has borne fruit! After we defeated the great Stellarwyrm, even more stellarite seems to have poured out from its essence!.\n\nWe can either harvest these for our own uses, or attempt to reignite once again, perhaps something interesting could happen?"
stellarite_events.1000.a: "Good Bounty!"
stellarite_events.1000.b: "Negative, just harvest the stellarites."
stellarite_events.1000.c: "Yes, let's try that." 
stellarite_events.1000.c.tooltip: "You are crazy aren't you?"

stellarite_events.1001.desc.a: "The Stellarite Lifeform seems to have materialize into a very distinct shape, that of an ether drake. Scans indicate it is much stronger than the usual ones. But if we can defeat it, we may be able to harvest large amount of stellarites."
stellarite_events.1001.desc.b: "Yet another Stellarwyrm has materialized...it is as strong as the last one. The options to deal with it remains the same, however."
stellarite_events.1001.a: "Finally a worthy foe!"
stellarite_events.1001.b: "This is going to hurt, is'n it?"

stellarite_events.12.name: "Kaboom!"
stellarite_events.12.desc: "Due to our reckless use of Stellarite Reactors on [FROM.GetName], the generators suffer meltdown after prolonged exposure to each other's massive heatwaves. This results in a powerful explosion that blows up the reactor and turns some of our populations into ashes of history."
stellarite_events.12.a: "Oops."
 
stellarite_events.13.name: "Massive XPLOSION!"
stellarite_events.13.desc: "Due to our reckless use of Stellarite Reactors on [FROM.GetName], the generators suffer critical meltdown after a technician pressed the wrong button after prolonged working hours. The generators blew up and caused a massive apocalypse that wipes out the colony. Reports indicate that all pops are now properly barbequed.\n\nA team of medics has been sent in an attempt to heal the survivors, but there are no survivors."
stellarite_events.13.a: "Excel...wait no this is very bad news indeed!"
 
stellarite_events.14.name: "Final Destination"
stellarite_events.14.desc: "Due to our reckless use of Stellarite Reactors on [FROM.GetName], one of the technicians responsible for maintaining the systems have accidentally fallen down the generator shaft and caused the entire building to explode. The resulting accident caused massive destruction and the planet is now nothing but molten rock and fire."
stellarite_events.14.a: "Oh well."
 
acot_stellarite_chain: "Stellar Power"
acot_stellarite_chain_title: "Stellar Power"
acot_stellarite_chain_desc: "There are theories and evidence that the power of the stars itself can be harnessed into powerful weapons beyond what is currently known. Details are skeptic but given enough resources and commitment, more information may be revealed."
 
acot_stellarite_experiment: "To Be or not to Be?"
acot_stellarite_experiment_desc: "Details are currently too sketchy, most of the science boards are skeptical of this so-called Stellarite power. There has been no records of any civilizations utilizing this power, not even the precursors. Given that concepts of solar energy have been widely known and adapted, there is very little reason to believe that there is more to it.\n\nRegardless, a group of scientists are willing to experiment, but an experienced scientist will be required to lead the project. While the scientist is not required to abandon the current task, only a few seem to display interests in such projects. Risks are high, so we should be careful with our approach."
 
acot_stellarite_research: "Mastering the Stars"
acot_stellarite_research_desc: "Now that it is clear that Stellarite is indeeed a formidable new power source. The next obstacle is to explore how to utilize the power in space warfare. Our early prototypes were too unstable and too dangerous to be used practically. As such, it is important that we develop a safe shielding device that can contain such powers without causing major explosion when subjected to various hazardous reactions.\n\nTo this end, a gifted scientist in the Physics Field will be required. The Scientist must either have Spark of Genius, Curator, Sapient AI Assistant, Erudite, Brainslug or Particles Expertises (Skill Level of 10 is also needed)"
