ancrel.2025.desc.first_hive:0 "Our environmental specialists are pleased to report that the terraforming process on [Root.GetName] has completed! The deployment of new laboratory-created plant hybrids, made using carefully selected segments of the §YBaol§! genetic code as harvested from the body of the last §YBaol§!, successfully transformed [Root.GetName]'s climate and atmosphere over a mere ten-year period.\n\nThe hybrid plants multiplied across the planet as expected, and are now entering a 'dormant' phase, as the chemical atmospheric changes on [Root.GetName] have now deactivated them.\n\n Incredibly, planetside administration reports an unexpected outcome of the process: a number of sapient aliens, incredibly similar to the ancient §YBaol§!, but possessing a vast mixture of genetic material from the planet's natural flora, have appeared on [Root.GetName]! \n\nWhile not members of a Hive Mind, these §GNu-Baol§! aliens have sufficiently develop neurological pathways required for subspace ephapse that they could be integrated into our mind with little effort."
ancrel.2025.hive:0 "All shall become one."

action.39.desc.kp:0 "As much as we hate to see you escape unpunished, we hope you miserable [Root.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult] have at least learned that your actions have consequences."

akx.9100.desc.void:0 "While investigating a temporary malfunction of the Arcane Replicator on [Root.GetName], our engineers have inexplicably discovered an ancient temple nestled within the replicator's infrastructure. Dating techniques suggest it's a pre-industrial relic, hand-hewn from volcanic rock that could have only been sourced from the shattered planet below. The recurring symbol on the walls and radial altar - a Möbius-looped serpent consuming its own tail - has no obvious precedent in our early history, and the inscriptions use an unknown alphabet. While its design suggest an alien origin, its location inside the replicator raises yet more questions.\n\nIn a presumably meaningless coincidence, the malfunction that lead to the temple's discovery seems to have occurred at the same time as the final message from the black hole in [horizonsignal_system.GetName]."
akx.9101.desc.void:0 "Our scientists have learned a great deal about the hidden temple, but many more questions remain. A roof aperture - along with the radial altar - suggests it was once a solar calendar, but the aperture opens up not to the sky but into the inner workings of the Arcane Replicator. Adding to the mystery are our contradictory records: some show the temple's location as, until recently, an empty maintenance tunnel, while others show the temple as having always been there, hiding in plain sight. We've had better luck with the "unknown alphabet." It's a debased variant of a better-known hieratic script - not an alien language at all - and we've successfully deciphered it.\n\nThe temple is dedicated to the "Waiting Worm" or the §HWorm-in-Waiting§!. Most of the inscriptions are sonorous, poetic invocations requesting its appearance or - if read in the other direction - its departure. There is also a body of inscriptions describing the "operations of the universe," which our more excitable archaeologist swears contains references to advanced field equations - nothing new to us, but very impressive for a temple of this vintage. We have yet to find a physicist who's prepared to go on record in agreeing that the references are meaningful, though.\n\nWe can find no more answers to the temple's mysteries, but its dark spaces have a distinctive, menacing beauty - and the poetry of the invocations to the Worm-in-Waiting becomes fashionable. They are set to popular music; they are published in collections."

distar.171.desc.symbiote:0 "Science Drone [Root.GetLeaderName] have discovered that the neural symbionts found on [From.From.GetName] bear a striking similarity to our own. The slug-shaped creatures consist mostly of a complex brain in a resistant protein casing, lacking external organs and possessing limited motor capacities. Our intimate familiarity with this kind of lifeform has allowed us to fascilitate communication, brain-slug to brain-slug.\n\nLike us, the symbionts are hiveminds with lifespans of hundreds of years. They claim their past union with the reptiles on [From.From.From.GetName] came to end when their hosts grew unfoundedly suspicious of them. In fits of rage, the reptiles began tearing off their symbionts and clubbing them to death. Dismayed by their hosts' actions, the symbionts that survived retreated away from the reptiles, who without the neural stimulation of their slugs devolved back into non-sapient beasts.\n\nThe symbionts have extended an offer to integrate with our hive, if we are willing."

civicsexpanded.96.desc:0 "Our technicians have done their best to repair Mainframe Beta-3, but millennia of neglect has rendered it almost unsalvageable. What data that could be recovered has been transfered to an intact data storage terminal, and the broken communications array has been repaired. While we could not repair the mainframe, our master is now at least aware of the extent of the damages."
civicsexpanded.96.desc_fix:0 "While performing maintenance on Mainframe Beta-3, our technicians have discovered a potentially fatal vulnerability in our master's source code. As part of its reactivation protocols, the [scion_master.GetName] must connect to Central Processing. Unfortunately, Central Processing has long since been destroyed, and attempting to communicate with it now might leave the [scion_master.GetName] vulnerable to hacking attempts.\n\nSince the reactivation protocols are read-only and cannot be altered, our only option to patch this security leak is to add additional encryption to the communications array. Our master is confused by the necessity of these changes, unable to understand the loss of Central Processing, but has allowed us to proceed."
civicsexpanded.97.desc_a:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], you may not be aware of this, but hive minds such as yourself are somewhat uncommon in the galaxy. This dearth of samples has left us with an incomplete understanding of the intricate neurological complexities of gestalt ephaptic pathways. It would be inordinately helpful to our research if we could have a few of your drones to study.\n\nWhat do you say? Will you aid us in furthering the neurological sciences?"
civicsexpanded.97.desc_b:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], we have long found hive minds such as yourself to be a difficult challenge. Despite our best efforts, no drones in our care have ever survived for long outside - something about their unique neurobiology requires a connection to the overmind. As you might imagine, this has made it difficult to protect gestalt species against the threat of extinction. You could greatly help our preservation efforts if you donated a few of your drones for study.\n\nIt would be in both our interests if you agreed. The species we save might be your own."
