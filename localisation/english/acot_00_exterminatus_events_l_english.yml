tech_bombardment_ae: "Exterminatus Protocol"
tech_bombardment_ae_desc: "Sometimes we must consign a million souls to oblivion in order to protect our empire's continued sovereignty. The blame lies not with the fleet admirals, no it is to those who force their hands into action, it is the enemies who refuse to accept their fates."

Purge and wipe all traces of civilizations off the planet by directing full power to all Alpha weapons.\n- §REXTERMINATUS§! damage to §YArmies§!\n- §REXTERMINATUS§! damage to §YTiles§!\n- §REXTERMINATUS§! damage to §YPops§!\n- Will delete all traces of life from the surface."
 
tech_bombardment_ae_final: "The Final Word"
tech_bombardment_ae_final_desc: "After witnessing first-hand the level of destruction that could happen from excessive bombardments, some of our more fanatical leaders have been trying to come up with ways to replicate the process in a more controlled manner. It is believed that once the planet is suitably damaged, a final warhead can be deployed to precisely turn the planet into a fractured world on our demand.\n\nThe same principal can also be utilized to shower the planets within our borders in case we have needs of our own ultrafractured worlds."
 
TECH_UNLOCK_AE_BOMBARD_FINAL_TITLE: "§EFinal Word:§! Allows the fleet to deploy a second-stage orbital bombardment after the planet has reached full devastation effect."
TECH_UNLOCK_AE_BOMBARD_DESC: "§EFinal Word:§! Allows the fleet to deploy a second-stage orbital bombardment after the planet has reached full devastation effect which will allow us to fracture a planet on demand.

bombardment_punishment: "§EPunishment§!"
bombardment_punishment_desc: "Punishment Bombardment aims to teach the primitives a harsh and painful lesson to make them understand the gravity of their situations.\n- §RDeadly§! damage to §YArmies§!\n- §RDeadly§! damage to §YTiles§!\n- §RDeadly§! damage to §YPops§!\n- Will bombard undefended planets until it's wiped clean if need be."
