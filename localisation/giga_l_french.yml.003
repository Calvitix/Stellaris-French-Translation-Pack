However, the Katzens only possessed limited FTL, and very few colonies outside their home system, which made the project tremendously expensive to their civilization. Although the terraforming structure was remarkably well-made, its sheer cost led to an economic collapse. Because of this, the Sobakis of Nienet, a civilization which shared the Gatzo system and were once close allies to the Katzens, decided to strike at Katzenland, in an attempt to conquer it while it was weakened, contradicting our original theory that the Katzens struck first.\n\nMeopa then retaliated with the 'fury of a thousand suns', completely and utterly devastating Nienet's surface. This disproportionate genocidal response led to a drastic drop in the nation's stability, which culminated with empire-wide revolts against Meopa's regime. Meopa, unwilling to step down, and his sanity rapidly deteriorating, proceeded to do the unthinkable:\nHe unleashed the rest of Katzen nuclear arsenal...upon Katzenland itself. He destroyed his own world, killing billions of Katzens and Ezicania. The relatively small Katzen space empire then collapsed, with the few colonies unable to sustain themselves without their capital.\n\nAlthough, the records spoke of a large colonization vessel labelled the §YMeopian Expedition 1§!, launched prior to the Sobaki-Katzen war towards an unknown faraway planet, which carried both Katzens and Ezicanias in cryosleep, meaning there is a slim chance the species are still out there, somewhere.\n\nOn the bright side, we have managed to recover surprisingly intact and detailed schematics of Projekt Katzenform, which will undoubtedly benefit our knowledge of terraforming."

But they are too complex and different for me to be able to really summarize them.\n\nThey seem to be mostly on board with Projekt Mondkanone, so they're contributing to its construction and providing economic aid to fund it.

The accused nationstates naturally denied this, but Kattail only intensified his accusations, demanding immediate financial compensation for the lives and materiel lost in the event.\n\nNegociations quickly broke down, with Kattail threatening war if his demands were not met, which they weren't. The Katzenartig Imperium and the other nationstates mobilized, and soon enough, a planet-wide war broke out.

    ehof_mega_trader.003.desc:0 "Greetings, §H[root.owner.GetSpeciesClassPlural]§! from the beyond. Welcome to our glorious utopia and home, $ehof_trader_new_system$.\n\nWe are the $ehof_trader$ and our intentions are peaceful. It may appear rude to you that we don't introduce ourselves further, or let you introduce yourselves first, but the situation is urgent.\n\nWe must ask you if you possess an extremely rare resource, which is essential for the survival of our civilization.\n\nDo you possess $ehof_alt_qnm$?"
    ehof_mega_trader.003.a:0 "What is $ehof_alt_qnm$?"

    ehof_mega_trader.004.desc:0 "$ehof_alt_qnm$ is a unique and unimaginably rare form of matter, which possesses properties like no other.\n\nIt has a negative gravitational charge, a negative mass, and is able to negatively warp spacetime.\n\nThis unique property is what allows us to stabilize $ehof_trader_dt$.\n\nWe're happy to tell you more about it, if you possess $ehof_alt_qnm$ and would be ready to share some of it with us. There would be a reward for your kindness!"
    ehof_mega_trader.004.a:0 "This sounds similar to $ehof_qnm$"

    ehof_mega_trader.005.desc:0 "So you know about $ehof_alt_qnm$?\n\nIf you have $ehof_qnm$ you could trade, we would reward you a great treasure from beyond $ehof_trader_dt$, which may be very useful to you.\n\nWe could even show you the pathway to some of the extraordinary solar systems, which were located while mapping the stars with the gifts granted to us by $ehof_trader_d$.\n\nWill you help us, §H[root.owner.GetSpeciesClassPlural]§! from the beyond?"
    ehof_mega_trader.005.a:0 "You've got yourselves a deal"

    ehof_mega_trader.006.desc:0 "Salutations, §H[root.owner.GetSpeciesClassPlural]§! from the beyond\nThough you're most welcome to stay as long as you like, we need time to replenish our stock and as such you will need to wait §H£time£5 Years§! before we can offer you different goods.\n\nDo you have some $ehof_qnm$ you would like to trade?"

    ehof_mega_trader.006.c:0 "$ehof_trader_new_system$ has so many wormholes..."
    ehof_mega_trader.006.c.response:0 "Wormholes are our primary form of interstellar travel. We're capable of generating both permanent and temporary connections, much like the ones you are able to create.\n\nWe have yet to discover any other means of interstellar travel and though you may be tempted to offer us other methods of interstellar travel, we would prefer to discover them in our own time, should the need arise.\n\nIn order to open a wormhole between $ehof_trader_new_system$ and the target system, we have to travel to the target system and build a wormhole constructor to create a psionic link between the two systems. Then we open a wormhole, by aligning the wormhole constructors through the psionic link and use a tremendous amount of psionic energy to rip open the wormhole simultaneously in both systems.\n\nThrough the use of $ehof_qnm$, we can stabilize the systems indefinitely. The wormholes will then be linked and traversable. This is why we need $ehof_qnm$, without it the wormholes would only be temporary and would collapse shortly after being opened. We only open wormholes from $ehof_trader_new_system$ to the others, because it is our central hub, our home, and the amount of $ehof_qnm$ we possess to open wormholes is limited. Or at least it was until we happened across you.\n\nIt is possible for us to create temporary wormholes in order to travel to other systems without a wormhole constructor, but doing so takes more energy, with no means of returning any extracted resources. This is not beneficial to $ehof_trader_new_system$ and our dream of building a utopia of never before seen magnitudes. It has been a goal we set to achieve a millennia ago, after the great war and the events inside our original home system, $ehof_trader_old_system$.\n\nHowever, with your technology, these systems would be beneficial to you and you would be free to do with them whatever you desire."

    ehof_mega_trader.006.e:0 "What is that $CREATORGATE_GALACTIC$?"
    ehof_mega_trader.006.e.response:0 "The $CREATORGATE_GALACTIC$ has been here long before our existence. It is said our predecessors learned how to unlock $ehof_gateway_disableds$.\n\nIf you have any $ehof_gateway_disableds$, we would be prepared to give insight on how they work in exchange for some $ehof_qnm$."

    ehof_mega_trader.006.d:0 "What do you know about $ehof_qnm$?"
    ehof_mega_trader.006.d.response:0 "Though we discovered $ehof_qnm$ long ago, we have yet to unveil all of its secrets. What we do know is that it cannot be, or at least extremely unlikely to emerge naturally.\n\nIts properties appear to violate multiple fundamental laws of physics. For example, the stress component of the stress-energy tensor is larger than the mass density of the space in which it is located, which should be impossible.\n\n$ehof_qnm$ is not like the pseudo-negative mass like properties of the negative energy density of the vacuum, which fuel the cosmic expanse. It is a true form of negative mass, which could not have occurred within the passed lifetime of the universe.\n\nThe fact that you have $ehof_qnm$ in larger magnitudes than we were ever able to gather from $ehof_trader_dt$, without creating it yourself, means it was either created in an extremely unlikely event, or it was in fact created by advanced beings, capable of its creation. We believe the latter to be true."

    ehof_mega_trader.006.b:0 "We'd like to know more about you"
    ehof_mega_trader.007.desc:0 "What would you like to know?"
    ehof_mega_trader.007.a:0 "Who are you?"
    ehof_mega_trader.007.a.response:0 "We are the $ehof_trader$, an egalitarian society of techno-organic lifeforms, gifted with psionic abilities by $ehof_trader_d$.\n\nOur goal is to make $ehof_trader_new_system$, our central solar system, into an astonishing utopia of unseen magnitudes.\n\nWe live in harmony with $ehof_trader_d$, who are guiding us and helping us to achieve this ultimate goal, while we grow together and evolve peacefully and mindfully."

    ehof_mega_trader.007.b:0 "What is your history?"
    ehof_mega_trader.007.b.response:0 "Our central hub, $ehof_trader_new_system$ is connected to $ehof_trader_old_system$, our original home system. You may have noticed, the whole system is devastated and filled with the remains of numerous ships and constructs. These are the remains of the fleets, habitats and structures of our organic forerunners.\n\nMillennia ago, when they were still planet-bound, $ehof_trader_dt$ was already in $ehof_trader_old_system$. It is unknown how long it has existed there, but it is at least as old as our history. When they first witnessed the existence of $ehof_trader_d$, they set their focus on reaching it. Even though it took them centuries until they were able to leave their home world, their focus never wavered. Reaching $ehof_trader_dt$ was their main goal. $ehof_trader_t$ appeared to be some kind of planet, in reality, it is a gate, a portal to an extra-dimensional realm, $ehof_trader_realm$.\n\nWhen they first physically entered $ehof_trader_realm$, they came into contact with the entity. It was kind and considerate, teaching them about the wonders of the inter-dimensional reality, that watches and dreams, $ehof_shroud$. They began to live in harmony with $ehof_trader_d$ and were guided by it, to achieve a higher state of society and being. It is the reason we have psionic abilities, which manifested shortly after the first contact with $ehof_trader_d$. Their civilization developed into a glorious, stellar empire, $ehof_trader_dominion$. All worlds of $ehof_trader_old_system$ were colonized and the empire was centered around $ehof_trader_dt$.\n\nUnfortunately, this astonishing expansion and development was not ever-lasting. The maximum capacity of $ehof_trader_old_system$ was reached, and without additional worlds, the resources would soon be depleted and the great stellar empire would perish. The only logical consequence was extra-stellar expansion. Faster than light travel technologies had not been developed yet and sending countless people with generation ships and resources to a neighboring system, in order to terraform it into a suitable one, was no option.\n\n$ehof_trader_dominion$ decided to develop a form of machine intelligences, which would be able to traverse the gap between $ehof_trader_old_system$ and the most suitable system, $ehof_trader_new_system$, to terraform it for the empire. These were the forerunners of the machines, $ehof_trader_machines$."
