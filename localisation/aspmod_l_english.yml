 ### Archaeology: When the world sings
 site_ASP_when_the_world_sings:0 "When the World Sings"
 site_ASP_when_the_world_sings_intro:0 " Our explorers are reporting strange sounds that can be heard from every location on the planet. §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! is apparently full of music ... or something that sounds like music. Whatever it is, listeners describe feeling "very comfortable" and call it "exceptionally pleasing."\n\nWe need to further investigate this "§Hmusic.§!""
 ASPmod.1.name:0 "When the World Sings"
 ASPmod.1.desc:0 " We've discovered something odd about §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. Observations from orbit did not reveal anything physically unusual, but we've picked up a continuous sound with specific periods and pitch, which can be heard anywhere on the planet.\n\n This planet is apparently full of music... or something that sounds like music. Whatever it is, listeners describe feeling "very comfortable" and call it "exceptionally pleasing."\n\nWe will need more time to investigate this "§Hmusic.§!""
 ASPmod.2.name:0 "Source of the Music"
 ASPmod.2.desc:0 " The music is originating from ruins scattered across the planet. While these ruins did not house their builders as we expected, they are home to clusters of living organisms similar to tunicates who produce sound via organs acting like vocal cords. The music on this planet is composed by singing invertebrates!\n\n While unexpected and beautiful, we are left with many more questions: where did the ruin-builders go? Did they also create these organisms? What is the purpose of this melody?\n\nFurther excavation is needed."
 ASPmod.3.name:0 "Planet-Scale Research Project"
 ASPmod.3.desc:0 " We have found evidence that §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! was used to conduct a planet-scale research project. Data compiled from the various ruins has provided some explanation of the ruin-builders intentions, but disturbingly little else. We now know they had comprehensive talents for genetic engineering and neuroscience, and that the ruins were facilities for that research. From what we've been able to translate, their research sought"§HAscension§!" and "§HTranscendence§!". Our best interpretation, however, is they obsessed over the concept of "§HBlooming.§!" It is unclear from the state of the ruins and planet whether their research was successful.\n\nWe will continue to study this "§HBlooming§!.""
 ASPmod.4.name:0 "The Blooming Project"
 ASPmod.4.desc:0 " Further analysis of data collected in the research facilities has led to another breakthrough: the "§HBlooming§!" project. The ruin-builders were researching an artificially created gestalt consciousness, a form of life they saw as their pinnacle of evolution. They believed a single, unified mind would abolish conflict and lead their society into a new enlightenment. Their approach focused around growing neural connections via gene therapy... connections they shared with each other.\n\n Apparently, they also succeeded: the "§HBlooming§!" project was carried out by infecting their atmosphere with a delivery retrovirus. The virus itself seems to have died out, but, given the lack of other inhabitants, it is reasonable to assess it affected their entire population, and that the organisms singing in the ruins are what became of the ruin-builders.\n\n Further study is required to validate this hypothesis."
 ASPmod.5.name:0 "The Gestalt Consciousness"
 ASPmod.5.desc:0 " Further research into the singing organisms has shown the ruin-builders were successful building their gestalt consciousness... to some degree. The "singing" is a shared vocal synchronization of their internal neural state, and fully aligned. These organisms are in a verifiable hive mind. Therefore, based on what we can observe, we must conclude the "§HBlooming§!" project produced the intended results.\n\n However, more in-depth studies of their nervous responses and processes indicate this gestalt consciousness is reporting a single, powerful emotion: pain. Without the original retrovirus or species, it is impossible to know if something went wrong before or after the project completed. However, the vocalizations coming from these organisms is not a song:\n\n§RIt is a unified, harmonious scream.§!"

 ### Archaeology: A Bedroom Planet
 site_ASP_a_bedroom_planet:0 "Bedroom Planet"
 site_ASP_a_bedroom_planet_intro:0 " A large number of abandoned structures have been found on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. These buildings are highly sophisticated and designed to efficiently meet the survival needs of their inhabitants. Unexpectedly, they also happen to be filled with the corpses of those inhabitants.\n\nFrom what we've been able to piece together, this species relied entirely upon these vast automation systems for their survival. Their subsequent deaths, coincidentally, appear to have been caused by the widespread failure of those systems. In fact, most of these buildings are dwellings devoid of other apparent functions. It's like a massive assisted living complex.\n\n We've discovered a few industrial and military installations among the vast array of automated buildings, but the ratio of dwellings to infrastructure suggests this group relied near-exclusively on external support for survival.\n\nWe'll keep digging and see what else we can come up with."
 ASPmod.10.name:0 "Ground Survey"
 ASPmod.10.desc:0 " In addition to minimal infrastructure, the inhabitants of this planet had little-to-no signs of economic activity either. Wreckage from orbital elevators and space station debris found across the planet's surface supports our theories that the inhabitants relied heavily, if not entirely, upon imports of food and other consumer goods. The only real activity they seem to have been involved in was lichen cultivation. Facilities were also uncovered in the central areas of their residences; perhaps these lichens were part of their diet or entertainment?\n\n Regardless, the characteristics of this cultivation are inconsistent with the planetary ecosystem, suggesting it is not native. Even more confusingly, these systems are completely isolated from the outside environment to a degree of fanatic paranoia. These spaces have been exceptionally well secured, yet, unlike the residences, there are no traces of the actual lichens that were being cultivated.\n\n Further investigation will be required."
 ASPmod.11.name:0 "The Ranches"
 ASPmod.11.desc:0 " We've pieced together a more complete picture of the fate of the inhabitants of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. The residential facilities only provide for survival because that is all they were designed to do. This planet was dedicated to the industry of ranching cattle, and the species we found was presumably being raised as that food source. We suspect the odd lichen facilities were the residences and control centers of their owners, and that we incorrectly assumed the role of rancher and livestock. However, we do know that the livestock species died out because these automated systems were purposefully turned off.\n\n It is a bit horrifying, a species closely resembling our own serving as a §Ydelicious delicacy§! for some unknown alien. Thankfully there is nothing in our records about a lichen-like civilization that eats people. Nonetheless, based on the size of the ranch, we can safely posit there was a massive demand for §Ylivestock§! raised in this facility: their empire would have been quite large.\n\n It's uncomfortable, but, given the similarities between our species, these spaces could be refurbished to make comfortable residences for our own people."

 ### Archaeology: The First Music
 ASP_the_first_music_anomaly:0 "The First Music"
 ASP_the_first_music_anomaly_desc:0 " While exploring §Y[Root.GetName]§!, we repeatedly received a very strong signal. Our scientists claim that violent solar winds have been observed in the star system, but this signal is not from natural factors such as solar wind.\n\n Our scientists have determined that this is an artificial signal, and given how easily we found it, it seems that we need to study this signal."
 ASPmod.20.name:0 "The Signal"
 ASPmod.20.desc:0 " Recent violent solar winds have caused §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! to lose some of its atmosphere, and it appears that signals trapped in the planet's thick atmosphere have begun to flow back into space.\n\n In the aftermath of the solar wind, the signal was still mixed with noise, but as the stars stabilized, the signal became cleaner. According to our scientist, signals are sent from the planet's surface. Archaeological teams are moving to that point."

 ASPmod.22.name:0 "The Spherical Object"
 ASPmod.22.desc:0 " According to the archaeological team's findings, a spherical object was transmitting signals beneath the surface. The object, which was sending signals through thick crusts, slowly increased the power of the signal as our archaeological team got closer.\n\n The object creating the signals, as if guiding our team to it, finally appeared under a thick crust.\n\n What the archaeological team found was §Ya small ball-like metal machine§!, made up of an unknown material that our scientists say is beyond our understanding. When the archaeological team discovered the machine, it stopped emitting signals and remained silent. We were not able to analyze its sofware nor its internal structure because of its impenetrable exterior, but fortunately, the archaeological team recorded the last signal of the machine.\n\n §YIt's time for the intellects of the Empire to gather.§!"

By now the most intelligent people in our Empire have spent countless days and nights working on it, and hundreds of AIs were deployed to help decode the signal. Our chief researcher has just found a clue on how to decode it.\n\n §HThis password is music!§!\n\n A code composed of numerous scales was being sent into space. Music made with a cipher of sound scales, instrument vibrations, waveforms, etc would not be more beautiful than this music; no music in the universe can be more beautiful than this music.\n\n It's not just about the beauty that this music has. When this music is played, the laws of thermodynamics are ignored. In other words, entropy seems to reverse. It's literally a life-giving piece of music played in the early part of the universe!\n\n We don't know who got the machine to send out a signal of music, nor for what purpose, but this discovery gave us a glimpse into the secrets of the universe. We have not yet named this beautiful music, but it would be an honor for all of us to give it a new name."

 ### Archaeology: Dawn Star is Coming
 site_ASP_dawn_star_is_coming:0 "Dawn Star is Coming"
 site_ASP_dawn_star_is_coming_intro:0 " §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!'s surface has a crater so large that it can be seen from space. But the artificial forms of debris on the surface indicate that there was once a time of civilization on this desolate planet. A surface scan has shown that this debris appears to be the topmost part of a building. Most of the traces of civilization seem to be hidden in the sandstorms of the planet.\n\n Further investigation is required."
 ASPmod.30.name:0 "The Dawn Star"
 ASPmod.30.desc:0 " Our archaeological team has sent in their report from §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. According to the findings, all the civilizations that once flourished on this planet seem to have collapsed in just one night. A giant meteorite hit the planet, turning it into a hellscape in just a few hours. The discovery of a huge city buried beneath the crater suggests that the civilization that once lived here was very materialistic and possessed intelligence. Furthermore, based on primitive forms of satellites in low orbit around the planet, it is believed that they reached the early space age.\n\n At the same time, we found records of a song that was often sung. Although we initially didn't know what it meant, our researchers were able to translate one of the most repetitive words in the song.\n\n The word is "§HDawn Star§!.""
 ASPmod.31.name:0 "First Phrase"
 ASPmod.31.desc:0 " There was a variety of opinions among archaeologists at the site about the song, "§HDawn Star§!," which was discovered on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. It's a bit of a mystery that people with extremely rational and advanced civilizations repeatedly sang a single piece of music that was not just a local fad, but was identified across the entire planet, regardless of gender, age and strata.\n\n Archaeologists suggest this song as religious chant or shamanistic spells, but none of them gave a clear answer. But there was some success in translating this song."
 ASPmod.32.name:0 "Second Phrase"
 ASPmod.32.desc:0 " Archaeologists report that they have found decisive clues in the archaeological investigation of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. It appears that they made a desperate effort to avoid the extinction of their civilization before the meteorite fell. Since they observed the meteorite, a huge amount of records have been found, all saying that they tried to stop it.\n\n But all the efforts to destroy the meteorite with weapons, including nuclear missiles, or even change the trajectory of the meteorite, went unsuccessful. They were unable to prevent their destruction with their own strength, and realized that a bright star in the night sky was a disaster that would lead them to an end.\n\n They eventually started building huge escape ships to keep only a small number of people alive. Huge spaceships have been found all over the planet to carry as many people as possible, and most of them seem to have come to an end without even launching. Realizing that only a limited number of people could survive, people flocked to the ship, and force was used to control them.\n\n But those who wanted to survive the end of their world were equally desperate to seize the spacecrafts using force. A relatively undamaged device, which was found deep in the excavation site, contained a voice record that gave us a little §Ymore insight§! into the song of the new star, which was being sung by the men who were confronting the spacecraft at that time."
 ASPmod.33.name:0 "Final Phrase"
 ASPmod.33.desc:0 " The excavation of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! is complete. Our archaeologists couldn't find any new scientific discoveries or anything surprising at the excavation site. In fact, their remains were not special. But it's clear that their end will make a deep impression on our archaeologists. The residents seemed to have not given up hope of escape until the effect of the meteorite prevented the spacecrafts from launching. Their obsession with survival was more tenacious and desperate than any other species in the galaxy, but only a small number of escape ships were able to make it. \n\n Other escape ships that didn't leave the planet were attacked and destroyed in an attempt to get their supplies, while other spacecrafts exploded in accidents, drifted endlessly in space due to poor planning, or were completely forgotten. And when the last hope was lost, the citizens were left with despair and helplessness.\n\n From that point on, their communication records were completely cut off, and each region was completely isolated. There may have been communication failures due to the effect of the meteorite, but they didn't communicate with anyone, even if it was possible. They died slowly, but surely, listening to the occasional song of the dawn stars. Our archaeologists were able to restore a family's voice records, which appeared to have been recorded when the §Ymeteorite§! nearly reached the planet."

Carbon dating process tells us that the city is at least 6000 years old.\n\n It is hard to answer the reason why our architectural style can be found on the surface of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!, which is located a million miles away from our homeland. Weathering over several millennia has buried the city under sand and dust. More excavation will be needed for further investigation."

Its resemblance to ours is more than an appearance; the structure of a house of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! is made of ferrocement, the same as our houses in the last century. The appliances found inside the house are also of similar use to ours.\n\n It is controversial whether this similarity is from coincidence or from architectural convergent evolution.

A biologist on our science team also reported that the species has an organ that exhales acidic breath. The overall appearance of the species is disgusting and looks likes it has just jumped out from the §Y[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!'s nightmares.\n\n Meanwhile, our team has discovered that the institution we found seems to be a research foundation."

The research lab of the natives was full of cloning vats; we assume that their population growth depends on technology. Most of the vats are filled with §Y"horrible"§! dead bodies of the native species.\n\n The team found that the dead bodies in the vats have a trivial difference in appearance with the restored fossil. Its appearance is still §Y"horrible"§!, but the number of legs is decreased to 10. Some of the team members were opposed to continued investigation, due to its appearance."

What seems to be an endlessly continued array of vats is cut off at the front of gigantic blast door with a security device next to it on the wall.

Inside the last vat made before the collapsing of the civilization is a dead floating body genetically identical with our species.\n\n It seems that they genetically engineered their species into our species. Most of the records in the computer pointed out how the appearance of the species they made are horrible and intolerable.\n\n According to the document in the computer, this make-horrible-procedure was a punishment for a traitor or a brutal criminal.

 asp.1.desc:0 " Upon analysis, the debris revealed that two fleets with completely different designs and appearances had fought against each other in orbit of the planet.\n\n The majority of the debris belongs to the pattern A fleet, constituted of ships with colorful patterns along and a simple structure which must have made them easy to mass produce. However, they didn't have any necessary facilities for their crew, such as dining rooms and toilets. On the other hand, the pattern B fleet, had rather simple appearances on the outside, while boasting symbolic decorations on the inside along with traces of Zro.\n\n Unnecessarily large rooms were identified inside the pattern B fleet. They might have been used for religious ceremonies, as can be seen from the religious ornaments found in them. Unfortunately, the information on the pattern B fleet is very limited, which makes it difficult to find out more. Dispatching an expedition team to the planet for further investigation is advised."
 asp.2.name:0 "Colorful Ruins"

However, the painted ground looks too disorderly and rather messy to assume that there were specific intentions behind it. Some buildings have collapsed, but it has been confirmed that they only succumbed to many years of weathering and crustal movements, not to violent or destructive activities.\n\n Crashed ships with the pattern A lie on the surface, but our investigations show that most of them appear to have crashed on the surface due to a sudden shutdown of their internal circuits, not because they got shot. Anyway, there are no signs of sentient life here, only robotic debris with faded and partially peeled paint littering the ground in addition to the painted buildings and ship debris."

 asp.3.desc:0 " We found robots inside a building, painted in various colors just like the surface of the planet. While the robots outside were either rusted or withered to dust by age, the robots inside were still intact with much less external influence.\n\n It seems that the robots stopped functioning while painting the walls rather disorderly or carving their own image or unidentifiable figures on the walls using chisels and hammers. The circuits of these colorful robots have been damaged to the point where they are completely unrecoverable.\n\n However, we have found that the painted patterns on the rocks' surfaces or the outer walls of the buildings are in fact massive and extensive information databanks. We might be able to make use of this to find out how the civilization met its downfall."

However, the lyrics don't make any contextual sense, being made up of repetitions of similar words, and the irregular changes in pitch made it sound quite awful to our ears.\n\n The lyrics mostly praise and question the soul, and talks about the fear of unknown beings from different dimensions. Based on the results of these studies, we were able to understand what the painted letters on the surface are saying. They were are poetry or other kinds of literature.\n\n They were also talking about metaphysical problems, such as the wonders of life, the loss of souls, and fear caused by destruction, but most of them are not in rhyme and rather poorly written with very little literary merit."

From these findings, our researchers were able to figure out that the civilization was a machine civilization with one giant Gestalt Consciousness.\n\n By examining their database, we could learn about an another dimension called the Shroud and a planetary weapon which gathers and concentrates energy from the Shroud to devastate planets. The origin of the pattern B ships, as well as the civilization's countermeasures against them and combat histories, were found. We were also able to confirm that the civilization performed studies on Zro.\n\n The records revealed that all the ships of the civilization were destroyed. However, the majority of the records talked about art. Most of the data found in the research facility was either paintings, literature, and songs of various civilizations and their studies on them."

The planet was attacked by a planetary weapon that utilizes the energy of the Shroud, developed by a certain ultra-ancient civilization, and met its demise.\n\n Before the attack, the Gestalt Consciousness figured out that the weapon could not cause physical damage to organics. It seemed to have concluded that by understanding art, which is exclusively an an interest to organics, the robots composing the conscience would turn into life forms with souls and become immune to the Shroud's energy.\n\n As a result, the civilization began collecting and analyzing data about art. It tried to sing songs, create literature, and draw pictures on the planet surface, its ships, and its robots. However, the Gestalt Consciousness failed to understand what constitutes true art, and was eventually destroyed by the planetary weapon."

They gathered engineers who followed the mainstream religion and had them create a device that would make their home planet the center of the star system forever.\n\n The device was developed with the overwhelming support of the people, and the planet slowly began to stop while the celestial bodies began to orbit around the planet. As the planet stopped rotating, massive earthquakes occurred and gigantic tidal waves swept over the coasts.

The AIs predicted the inevitable devastation of the planet and warned their masters, who were not willing to give up their quest for the answer just yet. The masters ordered continuation of computation, and eventually met their demise along with the planet.\n\n The AIs continued their computation to get the answer, even after their masters were long gone. However, they came to disagree with each other on how to solve it. In the end, the most powerful and ruthless AI took out all other AIs and continued to compute the answer, until the planet became what it is now. After countless years, the surviving AI came into contact with the "white mollusc-mammal" specimen. Surprisingly, the AI determined that the creature had found the answer to the question of the planet's old masters, but an error of unknown nature prevented it from stopping computation.\n\n We recovered the AI core, and secured the unique specimen that the AI has been preserving."

 ASP_site_axis_of_planet_desc:0 " Scientific discoveries often come from coincidences. This one was such a case.\n\n If the test run of the new exploration probe had been performed elsewhere, if it wasn't faulty and thus did not crash, if one of our explorers didn't slip over 'the cylinder', and if the rotation axis of the planet hadn't inclined by 8 degrees as he fell, this common barren-type planet would have gotten no recognition from anybody.\n\n Our science vessel that was monitoring the situation sent a transmission to the explorer asking what had happened, which sounded more like a scream. The explorer reported that most of 'the cylinder' is buried deep into the ground and is longer than what could be scanned.\n\n Well, first of all, health check on the explorer should be performed, it's wonder they seem okay after being on the ground that moved at the speed of several hundred kilo meters per second."
 asp.36.name:0 "Chapter I"
 asp.36.desc:0 " Even our best scanners could not scan the whole of 'the cylinder', which is abnormally thin for being so long. However, it is certain that 'the cylinder' has penetrated the crust.\n\n Closet-wide smooth white cylinder, 'the needle' as our explorers call it, denies all attempts to scan the insides, and even though it is so incredibly long, it is embedded in the ground in the exact direction of the center of the planet without errors. Our explorers are more curious about the fact that nothing is around where the needle is, even more so than that its sheer length and the material it is made of. They have scanned the planet to be sure, but no signs of artificial activities whatsoever has been found, let alone ruins of a civilization with the technology level advanced enough to craft such a needle. It is stuck in the ground all alone, like a needle stuck in a ball of string.\n\n But the most strange thing is that pushing the needle makes the planet spin. Although our exploration team is so terrified that they refused to push the needle anymore, the rotation axis of the planet has already been slanted more than 60 degrees compared to the initial axis.\n\n Our explorers on the surface report that they have not felt the spinning of the planet, even though they have seen the sky spin and heard the safety alarm went off like crazy."
 asp.37.name:0 "Chapter II"
 asp.37.desc:0 " By performing experiments that compared the regular radio waves sent from the orbit against what the team detected on the surface, the team has revealed that the whole spherical space including until 400 km/s above the equator is spinning.\n\n The kind of thermal radiation that can usually be seen in a black hole has been observed on the spherical space, and the unique kind of gravity wave only can be detected when exiting normal space has also been detected. Our scientists are arguing that the whole planet is in another dimension.\n\n With renewed motivation, our explorers began analyzing the needle. The planet spun 257 turns during the collection of material sample of the needle, but our explorers already got used to it."

 asp.38.desc:0 " Our analysis say that the needle is made of alien materials never seen before. As far as we know, these kind of materials are quite astonishing, but of no use even if one had succeeded in making them.\n\n After ripping of the exterior parts of the needle, our team found nothing on the interior. No machinery, no sensors, but just a hole of unthinkable depth. They set up a drone transmission relay base, and sent a explorer drone down below. It wasn't completely empty. As it went deeper, it had to face stronger gravity currents, which eventually blew it up.\n\n Our second exploration team tasked with the boring task of searching the entire planet microscopically had unearthed another needle, on the opposite side of the planet. In fact, it is the same needle. As our team shoot a laser beam down the first needle, it came out the second one. The needle completely penetrated the planet.\n\n Scientist assume that the needle is serving a role as some sort of signal amplifier to rotate space, but are unable to come up with any explanations about how or why the needle came to be."

 asp.39.desc.1:0 " To advance the research anyhow, our explorers brought all kinds of things and people and observed the changes, and got a mixed bag of results.\n\n While the planet is spinning, the boiling point of water rose by 0.1 degrees celsius, and the probability of getting a different answer expected by the psychological analysis had gone up by 12% on average, and the amount of information every 27808 q-bits in basic quantum communication has gone up. More changes have been observed in various areas, and the extent of the changes changed according to the distance with the niddle.\n\n It's quite nice to find out something at least, but our scientist are having trouble getting a consensus on the reason of those changes. Conducting more experiments is needed."
 asp.40.desc.1:0 " After countless weirdly-improvised experiments followed by tedious manual checks, our team has discovered that the device is a sort of a wedge, forcefully binding the multiverse. The spheric space surrounding the planet is actually the intersecting space of 88 multiverses. The planet exists in 88 multiverses at the same time. It is using the comparatively forgiving laws of physics of the 15th univierse to spin space.\n\n The most reasonable assumption would be that the needle had been made to cross over to the other universe. Perhaps changing the direction of the needle changes the destination. Still, we have no idea how to use it, or who tried to use it or why did they tried. The only beings with the knowledge of using the device might have already gone over to other universes.\n\n It's unlikely that we will be using the needle as initially intended, but by powering up the needle we can reproduce the laws of physics of other universes albeit in small scale. Although the process consumes much energy, it could also help much in innovating our physics research."

 asp.39.desc.2:0 " Having lost all patience, as no new discoveries came despite our research efforts, one of our scientists went inside the needle without any protective gears!\n\n Now his voice is coming up the needle. It's so vivid and clear although the distance must be several thousand kilometers. It sounds like he's being chased by something. Sounds of burning flesh, cracking bones, and the screams of mercy come out. Our team on the surface tries to contact him, but to no avail. The scientist is trying to let the team know what's happening down there. It seems even when in pain, he is determined to give us the knowledge. He repeats the same thing again and again in a barley comprehensible, groaning voice.\n\n That it is hell down there. Demons and monsters, every conceivable evil are there.\n\n Soon the voice falters, and half of our explorers, even as shivering with extreme anxiety, showed obsessive curiosity towards the insides of the needle. They shove off their colleagues that were trying to stop them, and jumped down into the needle. The rest of the team retreated back to the science vessel in panic, as thick purple smoke began to spread over the surface.\n\n It seems like the planet has turned into a veiled planet. A report just came through informing that an unidentified purple ship has appeared out of thin air. The ship is armed with a single bizarre-looking cannon. It is just staying on orbit, not moving at all, which leads us to believe that it's not staffed. It might hold the answers we seek."
 asp.40.desc.2:0 " After decrypting the records found inside the ominous purple ship, our team was able to tell what the planet and the needle were.\n\n The cylinder we referred to as the needle was in fact 'The Roundworm of the Veil' - a psionic monster which had being traveling across galaxies and devouring the spirits and bodies of sentient beings. Even after destroying tens of thousand of civilization, the worm never felt full. The Vermifugum, a civilization that came under attack by the worm 790 million years ago, succeeded in neutralizing the worm, and created a prison between the veil dimension and the real universe, penetrated the worm with the bar of the veil dimension, contained it inside a rocky planet in the real universe. The planet was disguised as a common barren-type planet to prevent a younger species from breaking the seal by accident.\n\n The records also advised us at the end to use the 'flint' loaded on the purple ship to burn down the worm along with the veil, in case the seal is broken and the planet fell into the veil.\n\n As our scientists read the last part, they witness the worm escape from the planet and float away. They panicked as they realized that they have lost the last chance to destroy the worm, but fortunately for us the worm left for another galaxy.\n\n Only the surviving explorers know what we have done. May the monster never come back."

 #axis_of_planet_site_multi_end_3
 asp.39.desc.3:0 " Now the explorers are so used to the spin, that no one said anything about a explorer toying with the needle while they rested.\n\n Then, the explorer shouted that he'd seen clearly a continental planet through the needle hole. At first the others though he was just kidding, but as time went by, more and more people were having similar experiences.\n\n It soon became mandatory to write down the direction the needle was pointing to, at which angle the observer was holding the needle at the time of such occurrences. As the records piled up, it became clear that the needle showed specific planets according to the direction of the needle, the angle at which the needle was held, and what the explorer was saying at the time.\n\n The existence of the celestial bodies seen through the needles must be verified."
 asp.40.desc.3:0 " As the team fiddle with the needle according to what the scientists have discovered, the gravity current inside the needle stabilizes in lens-like form, and the view of the other side gets magnified. The celesital bodies the team had seen were indeed real, and the scientists could discover new planets as well.\n\n The needle is a gigantic deep space telescope. Whoever built this ridiculous telescope, or whatever techonolgies had been used to build it, we still do not know, but we do know how to use it.\n\n Research on areas that are not easily accessable by hyperspace travel was very difficult even to this day where we can see planets far across with ones own eyes and travel faster than light. However, this telescope will break open new possibilities for astronomy. Now observers can see the stars far across the galaxy as if they were right in front of their eyes, and they also can flim and analyze external galaxies more vividly. Our military leaders wanted to use the telescope in the field of espionage, but as it is impossible to zoom in once the planet is magnified to a certain degree, it's not likely that they can get useful information on the surface as they would have wanted.\n\n The telescope has also become quite famous for tourists. The now super popular needle is now called the 'Limitless Observatory', a perfect planetarium where tourists can see every single stars and planets in the galaxy."

While manipulating the needle, it pointed directly without error toward a barren-type planet within our empire.\n\n It is reported that suddenly the ground sank and an ancient building made of gold came out the hole on that planet. A signboards that says 'lock' is hanging on the building, and somehow tells us of a lock which only the chosen priest of Numa knows the location of, and the key which only the saint born from a four armed virgin knows the whereabouts of, and that only the one who knows where both items lie can open the lock and legitimately take the most holy light.\n\n Though none of us meet the criteria, since we have beaten even smaller odds, we should be able to 'legitimately' take what's inside.\n\n When the 'lock' opened, the needle, or rather the 'key' has changed. An elevator shoot up from the once empty hole, and the explorers took it to arrive at the vast ruins hidden inside the inner core of the planet."

 asp.40.desc.5:0 " Most of the probes that attempted FTL travel in the neighboring system traveled normally, but the ones that were on the direction at which the needle pointed had unusual occurrences. The probes that entered hyperspace lanes toward the system where the needle is at traveled at faster speed than normal, and the ones that entered hyperspace lanes toward other systems have been somehow teleported to the low orbit of the planet and crashed into the ground.\n\n However, only small ships like civilian spacecrafts and probes were affected. Anything with more mass than a patrol ship worked mostly fine. Also, it has been theoretically proven that by powering up the needle, we can cut pseudo-lightspeed by half according to the amount and polarization of the power supplied, and also suppress the overheating of engines when making a 'jump' onto the phase above ordinary universe.\n\n Our scientist have concluded for now that the needle had been constructed to create an 'FTL highway', and the rotating functionality of the planet was intended to serve as a switch point.\n\n However, no one knows how this thing works, or why should the needle be planted into the planet, or what kind of civilization had built it. No more leads exists.\n\n But our civilization has undeniably gained a lot from this incident. By building a device to control and power the needle and connecting it to the starbases, our species could take advantage of the needle's abilities."

Our brief survey revealed two important facts.\n\n First, we are not alone. There are countless other beings on the planet. To be more precise, they are some kind of doll resembling certain life forms, presumably their creators. They appear to have been made to perform various tasks for the inhabitants of the planet, based on the clothing they are wearing. There are enough of these dolls to replace an entire planet's population. However, all of them are now dormant.\n\n Second, the planet is still very well maintained.

More confusingly, the dolls were placed in such a way that one would think they were family. What's more is that there are also factories, schools, and cultural facilities on the planet with dolls in them.

Although we cannot quite make out what they are saying yet, it feels like they are greeting someone.

It was a magnificent show, with the main character being replaced many times as generations passed. This occurred for thousands of years. Everything in the planet was made for that individual only.\n\n The protagonist was born in a secluded small town, enjoyed a peaceful life, and eventually passed away. The protagonist lived their entire life without knowing that they were in a show. Of course, as the years went by, there had been changes in the show as well. During the early years, the show was no different from the dramas our citizens watch. Intrigue and betrayal, love and revenge, hardships and adventures...\n\n But as time went on, the story became more and more plain. Simple, ordinary life...

At its golden era, this civilization held a large portion of the galaxy, but gradually faced an inevitable decline. Due to the unmaintainable large population and depleted resources, most of the citizens were forced to endure a terrible quality of life. In order to remedy this problem, the leaders had come up with an interesting idea.\n\n It was to show its citizens a show so grand that they would forget the hardships they were facing.\n\n This show was based on the days where the civilization was still young, with its citizens enjoying prosperity and comfort. It seems that all the citizens got hooked into the show, including the ones that ordered the creation of this show.\n\n In the beginning, real actors starred in the show. However, as the entire society came to demand to be in the show, it began to cast ordinary people as actors. Eventually, the competition to be selected as the protagonist overheated so much, that they had to cast a real baby as the main character.\n\n Viewers left various review about the show. Most of them are related to the main character. They expressed affection, envy, jealousy, hatred, worship, and even murderous intent...\n\n One day, the show ended suddenly. Perhaps the civilization had met its inevitable end. From the records of the last moments, it seems that civilization tried to keep the show alive until it ran out of resources. Our search for other traces of the civilization has revealed that all other planets belonging to the civilization have already turned into dust. It seems that the civilization destroyed these planets in order to get resources to support the show. This show is the civilization's only legacy.\n\n Now there is only one question left. Where did the main character go?"

Although he has left only a few records, we were able to infer the climax of the show.\n\n The ending seems to have come abruptly. First, all dolls stopped acting. Perhaps because the home planet was unable to provide them with scripts anymore. Soon after that, social infrastructures began to collapse one by one, presumably because the energy supply from the home planet was cut off. The protagonist seems to have been shocked to realize that the ones he loved were mere puppets, and that his world was just a filming set.\n\n He was devastated by the truth, but soon became motivated to leave the planet. Was he trying to find his real kin that might exist? Around his body are the remains of various attempts he devised to leave the planet. Mechanisms, planes, and various types of primitive rocket ships....\n\n All attempts have failed, and the last attempt seems to have led him to death. All that remains is his dead body.

The extinction process must have been very quick, as current ecosystem of the planet only consists of protist life forms with simple genetic pool.\n\n It is quite clear that [From.Planet.GetName] is among those 'unlucky' inhabitable planets, but one thing is still open to debates. Most of the ancient creature fossils are too large if we put the scale theory to practice, that they couldn't have possibly been able to survive on the planet.\n\n Just what were those creatures?

Our researchers assume most of the life forms native to the planet have been wiped out without a trace by the destructive shockwave created by the whales' fall, as smaller fossils are so rare.\n\n In the layer which dates back to 600 million years ago, some vague traces of a civilization presumably built by sentient creatures remain. The exploration team might be simply mistaken as most of the data found are either too simple or too distorted.

They didn't have to worry about fuel consumption as the Tiyanki whales' corpse provided them with nearly limitless supply of oil.\n\n They tried until the very end to survive, but seeing the remains of the wheeled tower, our researchers had to conclude that their efforts proved useless."

They relied solely on the corpses to supply themselves with necessary resources, even using the corpses as habitats.\n\n Although there were regional differences as to how advanced were the technologies they had used on the whales, most of the regions had similar looking remains of artistic activities, such as symbols, made of whales' bones.\n\n The meaning of the symbols are not clear yet, but the team is fascinated by the fact that deeper they dug, the more sophisticated the symbols were.

It is highly unlikely that such a advanced and sophisticated civilization had fallen so rapidly right down to primitive level just because of giant whales falling from the sky.\n\n This discovery was the last nail on the coffin for the theory that Tiyanki whales' funerals caused the periodic extinction of the planet. Since from what our team has learned, the impact of falling whales are not quite powerful enough to wipe out an entire civilization, although being pretty destructive in their own right.\n\n If tens of thousands of Tiyanki whales came to the planet for their funerals at the same time, it's theoretically possible to have caused the extinctions, but one such event is highly unlikely.

At the epitome of their civilization, the falling whales were no longer feared, but rather regarded as mere obstacles on their road to space exploration.\n\n However, according to their recordings found in the ruins, the whales brought upon them their doom as our scientists initially presumed.\n\n The great extinction came when all the whales' corpses exploded at once.\n\n The ruins look completely safe.

Even if some do explode on the surface, the resulting poisonous gases are too light and too little to be of any threat, and soon float off the planet's atmospheric layer.\n\n For that reason, many argued against the government's idea of shooting down falling whales with interplanetary nuclear missiles. However, they were soon swayed over to the pro side by the first successful shoot down of a whale.\n\n Sadly, they failed to take into account the whales' spiritual bond. As some of their friends were deprived of their rightful funerals, countless Tiyanki whales in the vicinity roared with rage, charging towards the planet. The empire's officials have left behind a pretty descriptive illustration of the dreadful situation.\n\n Massive amount of nuclear weapons had been fired at the whales, but they made matters worse. Some whales were caught in the nuclear blasts near the planet crust, which in turn led to a disastrous chain explosions of space whale corpses underground.\n\n Countless explosions of enormous scale soon followed. The air practically burned with poisonous gases, against which the empire could not hold, unlike the planet.\n\n But as we already know, small number of people survived somehow. They might have been able to prosper again, if not for the whales' grudge against the planet. The space whales specifically targeted the planet as their preferred funeral spot from then on.\n\n According to their ancient records, there weren't many casualties of falling whales before the incident, which is how we could trace back to the truth. The construction of the wheeled tower, and the building of habitats inside whales' corpses were both the last efforts of the remnants to avoid the falling whales, which now specifically targeted them.\n\n We know the rest."

Although it seems to be inhabited solely by plant life, yet ruins possibly of once advanced civilization exist.\n\n Our explorers arrived at the great city ruins, which we presume to be the once-prospered capital of the planet.

Most of those symbols are adorned with jewelry, which led our researchers to believe that the symbols are somehow related to the dominant religion or ideology.\n\n Many messages have been found inside those 'temples' as our team calls them, but most of them do not seem to be more than mere symbols.

The plants could draw nutrients from the organic matter that the animals have left behind and grew rapidly, our scientists concluded.\n\n Among the said bones, some were distorted to badly to the point where their origins could not be traced.

In the complex were an abundance of recordings which showed the last days of the civilization.\n\n The inhabitants believed that death is not the end, and all conflicts will end by being spiritually united with the resurrected, which led them to refrigerate dead bodies in the temples, and try to research resurrection technology. But their research did not result in not resurrections, but biological abominations.

This is the meaning of the core belief of the planet's religion- death, resurrection and union.\n\n But it seems a certain heroic group of engineers defeated this abomination using an early model excavation ship. They were able to slip into the orbit of the satellite, avoiding its attacks, and then used the gigantic excavator to practically rip off the core of the satellite, and the dark structure along with it. The corpse-satellite met its doom, and the galaxy became a bit safer thanks to this heroic feat.\n\n The heroes seem to have been able to evacuate to the surrounding area of their homeworld.

Our scientists could not find the reason behind the unnatural amount of blood cells in the water. Yet, they have a theory that some sort of organism have caused this. Although oxygen is poisonous for most primitive organisms, it is a pretty common process that the oxygen-emitting bacteria change the composition of atmosphere completely. There might exist organisms that multiplies blood cells, though our scientist are unsure how it might benefit such organisms.\n\n The dark cloud was made up of aerosol and toxic gas, and the destruction of the planet had a similar pattern to that of a dead planet, with no signs of an attack from outside.
