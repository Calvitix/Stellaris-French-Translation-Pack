 ## FTL speed ## 
 GT_ftl_speed_1:0 "Mass Locking"
 GT_ftl_speed_1_desc:0 "Advanced FTL sensors allow for a much stronger mass-lock on the target sun vastly increasing our ability to travers the FTL current."
 
 GT_ftl_speed_2:0 "Current stabilization"
 GT_ftl_speed_2_desc:0 "Advancements in our engine design reduces turbulence in the FTL conduits."
 
 GT_ftl_speed_3:0 "Condensed Warp Bubble"
 GT_ftl_speed_3_desc:0 "A smaller warp bubble around our vessales greatly speed up are ability to travel through the FTL conduits."
 
 GT_ftl_speed_4:0 "Negative-Mass Core"
 GT_ftl_speed_4_desc:0 "A second energy core designed to produce a negative-energy field vastly speeds up our FTL travel by reducing the energy needed to accellerate."

 #43 - ship emergency warp-out bonus
 GT_ship_emergency_ftl_min_days_add:0 "Evasion Drives"
 GT_ship_emergency_ftl_min_days_add_desc:0 "Special hyper-warp drives designed to activate according to programmed scenarios. When a situation becomes untenable, these drives begin automatic calculations of available hyperlanes, then engage immediately, improving chances for successful escape."
 #44 - science ship survey speed bonus
 GT_science_ship_survey_speed:0 "Deep Space Sensors"
 GT_science_ship_survey_speed_desc:0 "Improved long-range sensors give survey ships the ability to detail and map a celestial object from light years away, improving the speed at which data is able to be gleaned about survey targets."
 
 gee_science_ship_survey_speed_2:0 "Autonomous Planetary Surveyors"
 gee_science_ship_survey_speed_2_desc:0 "An array of autonomous drones that drop from orbit to scan and map every part of the planet."
 
 gee_science_ship_survey_speed_3:0 "Cosmic Radiation Scanners"
 gee_science_ship_survey_speed_3_desc:0 "By utilising a combination of the cosmic background radiation and neutrinos our science ships can scan both the surface of planets as well as their entire internal makeup"

 #55 - mining station construction speed bonus
 GT_shipsize_mining_station_build_speed_mult:0 "Construction Tug Ships"
 GT_shipsize_mining_station_build_speed_mult_desc:0 "Medium-sized automated ships that can carry great weights as well as construct facilities. When paired with a Construction Ship, they can assist in the building of mining stations at speed."
 #56 - research station construction speed bonus
 GT_shipsize_research_station_build_speed_mult:0 "Research Logistics"
 GT_shipsize_research_station_build_speed_mult_desc:0 "Improvements to Research Station organization and construction have increased the rate at which they can be built."
 
 #50 - hyperlane travel speed bonus
 GT_ship_interstellar_speed_mult:0 "Nova-class Hyperdrive Upgrade"
 GT_ship_interstellar_speed_mult_desc:0 "These hyperdrive upgrades combine two different schools of intergalactic travel. Fusing warp technology with an advanced hyperdrive improves interstellar travel by a magnitude comparable to previous drives."
