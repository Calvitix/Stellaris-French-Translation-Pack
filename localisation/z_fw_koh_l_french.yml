It seems to have found some kind of huge machine, which seems to be a seal with something buried in it, and they are trying to scan it.\n\nEverything is running as usual, and suddenly the signal becomes unstable, they seem to be in trouble. In the intermittent audio communication, we can only hear the cry of the crew's fear, scattered gunshots, and... some kind of girlish hustle and laughter, which is really weird!"

They thought that §B[Root.GetLeaderName]§! must have been absorbed and replaced by some indescribable existence. But the answers from the investigation team and §B[Root.GetLeaderName]§! Show that they seem to be themselves, regardless of character or information they know!\n§B[Root.GetLeaderName]§! Said the huge machine suddenly turned on, and it was indeed sealed with something in it. It was a cat ear head covered with tentacles, and this split head attacked them. As for the latter things, they also forgot.\n§B[Root.GetLeaderName]§! It is recommended that this head be recovered, and be quarantined and imprisoned after boarding the ship, and other matters will be returned to the Imperial Research Center for processing. The crew discussed for a long time and decided to accept her proposal. There is also good news that the investigation team accidentally obtained some boxes full of alloys and bitcoins from near the machine. These resources can be used by the empire."

All the mysteries are also solved:\n\nIn ancient times, Astraia lived a group of carefree girls who built a great civilization and a splendid culture. But one day, one of them, named Kiruyi Momocha, was suddenly persecuted by others because she looked like a skunk. Everyone hated her and gave her a cursed name, Karyl.\nKiruyi Momocha is very angry, but she has no friends, everyone squeezes her out. So she prayed to the voice in §Hthe Abyss§! For refuge from the depths of the stars, and §Hthe Abyss§! Answered her and gave her the ability to immortalize and assimilate others.\n\nThis assimilation method is both cruel and gentle, it allows the replica of Bade Hiliuye to tear off other people ’s heads and assimilate their bodies, while retaining their original soul intact. So everyone who laughs at Bahia Siliuye will become her and retain the original memory. Eventually, when everyone was assimilated, they were unwilling to suffer such humiliation, and they all broke off themselves, and Kiruyi Momocha also sealed herself sadly."

Then you will specify any system and sow replica of $z_fw_r_head_of_karyl$ on it. After the release, a wave of infections will be carried out on the target planet, and it will not stop until the entire planet's population has been transformed into the skunk species. Skunk species are a kind of cosmic plague. They will automatically infect other non-skunk species and add new traits and appearances based on their own species. As the number of people infected with skunks increases, the chance of mutation will also increase. High mutation possibility will produce new beneficial or harmful species, and trigger a series of unexpected chain results. §HIf you want to stop spontaneous infection, click the big LOGO to open the framework setting and disable the spontaneous infection.
