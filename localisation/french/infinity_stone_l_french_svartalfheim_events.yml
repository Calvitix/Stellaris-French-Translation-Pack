 svartalfheim.0.name:0 "The Planet In Darkness"
 svartalfheim.0.desc:0 "There appears to be a planet in the §HMalekith§! system orbiting the black hole. It wouldn't be the strangest occurrence, except there appear to be signs of civilization on the planet. Without a star, it seems unlikely that life as we know it could exist on the planet."
 svartalfheim.0.a:0 "It'd be worthwhile to investigate."

 svartalfheim_site:0 "Svartalfheim Digsite"
 svartalfheim_relic_world_site_desc:0 "Without a star it seems unlikely that life as we know it could exist on the planet."

 svartalfheim.1.name:0 "Svartalfheim and the Dark Elves"
 svartalfheim.1.desc:0 "Our archaeologists were quickly able to translate the language of the people of the planet through books on the surface. The people of the planet referred to themselves as "§YDark Elves§!" and the planet as §HSvartalfheim§!.\nAlthough the civilization seems primitive by our standards, the technology the Dark Elves possess easily matches or exceeds ours. It appears that this is because they were exiled here by another party, and had to rebuild their civilization with what they'd been left with.\nHowever, these books don't explain where the Dark Elves are now."
 svartalfheim.1.a:0 "Keep looking!"

 svartalfheim.2.name:0 "Rifts in Space"
 svartalfheim.2.desc:0 "Originally thought to be anomalies caused by the proximity to the black hole, our scientists have discovered the planet of §HSvartalfheim§! is covered in hundreds of rifts in space. These rifts lead to several other planets, however, the rifts are unstable, appearing and disappearing every few hours. Due to the instability of the rifts, it is difficult to work out where each rift leads, however, several people have "volunteered" to explore some of the rifts."
 svartalfheim.2.a:0 "Prepare expedition teams immediately."

 svartalfheim.3.name:0 "The Golden City"
 svartalfheim.3.desc:0 "Our researchers have worked out which are the most stable rifts on §HSvartalfheim§!. One of the rifts has never closed or moved since we detected it, so it was deemed most suitable for exploration. "Volunteers" entered the rift and one the other side found the remains of a city, floating in space. The city appears to be made of gold and is surrounded by sources of frozen water.\nThe people of this city have technology on par with the Dark Elves, however, the bones of the dead found in space indicate they're a different race entirely.\nThe expedition returned with may relics from the city to research."
 svartalfheim.3.a:0 "A city made of gold!"

 svartalfheim.4.name:0 "The 9 worlds"
 svartalfheim.4.desc:0 "After exploration, it appears that §HSvartalfheim§! is connected to 8 other worlds, each of which are is also connected through rifts. Each world appears lifeless like §HSvartalfheim§!, however, each world was home to a different civilization, ranging from a golden city floating in space, to a planet of fire and brimstone.\nHowever, rarely a rift appears that doesn't lead to another world, instead, it appears to be a rift between worlds, outside of reality as we know it. Our expedition is trying to map where one of these special rifts will appear next."
 svartalfheim.4.a:0 "Send teams to all 9 worlds!"

 svartalfheim.5.name:0 "The Reality Stone"
 svartalfheim.5.desc:0 " After mapping the location of the next rift between worlds, "volunteers" entered the strange place. The space through the rift was fluid, constantly changing and defying the fundamental laws of the universe. Not too far into this strange realm was a strange red liquid that appeared to influx with the realm. One of our explorers tried to touch the liquid and was immediately unmade, however, afterwards, the liquid turned into the §YReality Stone§!, one of the 6 cosmic infinities. Our expedition collected the stone and returned to Svartalfheim.\nAlthough the rifts to the 8 of planets are still present, after obtaining the stone, the rift between worlds never returned. It also appears that the rifts do not have a connection to the §YReality Stone§!, as once removed from the planet, the rifts persisted."
 svartalfheim.5.a:0 "Reality can be whatever we want!"

  # Thor Events
 svartalfheim.11.name:0 "A Mysterious Hammer"
 svartalfheim.11.desc:0 "We found a peculiar hammer in the ruins of the golden city. While appearing like an ordinary hammer, when anyone tries to lift in, it suddenly becomes impossible to move. Our drones and equipment can move the hammer, thus its gravitational effect only activates when lifted by the sentient.\nThere is an inscription on the side of the hammer which reads: "§MWhosoever holds this hammer, if thee be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.§!""
 svartalfheim.11.a:0 "We must find some worthy."

 svartalfheim.90.name:0 "Someone Worthy"
 svartalfheim.90.desc:0 "After days of searching, we found a doctor who was able to lift Mjölnir. They were immediately infused with the power to wield lightning and gifted super strength, speed, invulnerability and flight in space without a suit.\nThe power of §YThor§! also gives wisdom to its wielder and the doctor can perform many feats they previously did not know how to do.\n\nOur military advisors have suggested we give them their own fleet to command."
 svartalfheim.90.a:0 "Most Impressive."
 svartalfheim_get_thor:1 "An admiral named "§HThor§!" has been added to the leader pool."

 svartalfheim.91.name:0 "Someone Worthy"
 svartalfheim.91.desc:0 "After days of searching, we found a drone who was able to lift Mjölnir. They were immediately infused with the power to wield lightning and gifted super strength, speed, invulnerability and flight in space without a suit.\nThe power of §YThor§! also gives wisdom to its wielder which was, in turn, was passed back to the collective.\n\nWe have decided to give the drone their own fleet to command."
 svartalfheim.91.a:0 "They will make the collective stronger."

 svartalfheim.100.name:0 "The Death of Thor"
 svartalfheim.100.desc:0 "After Thor's tragic death, the source of their power, Mjölnir, flew into space at near-light speeds. Out scientists have been unable to track its trajectory and presume the hammer lost."
 svartalfheim.100.a:0 "They served us well."

 svartalfheim.101.name:0 "Mjölnir"
 svartalfheim.101.hadthor:0 "Although our scientists had given up hope searching for the legendary hammer Mjölnir, it has returned to us. The hammer is now wielded by a new individual, who has taken up the mantle of §YThor§!. With their new-found knowledge and power, they have offered to join us to serve in our military as their predecessor did."
 svartalfheim.101.nothadthor:0 "After a near-miss by one of our trade ships, we found a peculiar hammer flying freely through space. While appearing like an ordinary hammer, when anyone tries to lift in, it suddenly becomes impossible to move.\n\nWhilst investigating its properties a scientist lifted the hammer and was immediately infused with the power to wield lightning and gifted super strength, speed, invulnerability and flight in space without a suit.\n\nThe power of §YThor§! also gives wisdom to its wielder and the doctor can perform many feats they previously did not know how to do.\n\nOur military advisors have suggested we give them their own fleet to command."
 svartalfheim.101.a:0 "Most Impressive."
 svartalfheim.101.b:0 "They will make the collective stronger."

 svartalfheim.250.name:0 "Antimatter Upgrade"
 svartalfheim.250.desc:0 "After our research into §YAntimatter Reactors§! for our ships, our scientists have suggested that we apply the knowledge on antimatter to boost the power of the §RReality Stone§!.\n\nAs the §RReality Stone§! converts antimatter into matter, if we were to build some sort of pylon to boost to range at which the §RReality Stone§! could gather antimatter, we could use to the stone do much more than just create gaia worlds."
 svartalfheim.250.a:0 "Begin construction immediately."
 reality_stone_upgraded_tooltip:1 "We can now build §YAntimatter Pylons§! on our planets which will allow us to use the §RReality Stone§! on that planet to terraform it into §EEcumenopolis§."
