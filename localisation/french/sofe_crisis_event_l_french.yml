############## OE NEVER USE MONOLITH BEAM, BUT ANGRIER EMPIRES MAY

sofe_crisis.210.name: "[From.GetName] Removed"
sofe_crisis.210.desc: "The celestial beam from the [From.From.GetName] fades, and [From.GetName] is successfully erased, removing it from this galaxy.\n\nSome may call such action drastic and heartless. But those that understand the Light, will find that this is the preferable fate to actual destruction. The Light gives, and also takes. May the Stellarborne accounts in all balances."
sofe_crisis.210.desc.alt: "The frightening beam from the [From.From.GetName] fades, and [From.GetName] is silent.\n\nWhat happens below now, one may never know."
sofe_crisis.210.a: "It had to be done, for their own good."
sofe_crisis.210.b: "The Stellarborne will decide their fates."


##When a world is cleansed by OE fleets - Turns worlds back into Gaia or Oceanic/Continental
sofe_crisis.2.name: "The Stellarborne removed [Root.GetName]"
sofe_crisis.2.desc: "The fleets of the §HStellarborne§! have finished their operations on §H[Root.GetName]§!. Using unknown methods, the fleets have removed the entire colonies from the planet. Based upon the records, it seems they have been teleported away somewhere. The planet is terraformed to natural perfection, but the colony is effectively lost."
sofe_crisis.2.a: "But where did those people go?"

##When L-Gate is opened and OE emerges - By opener with only one gate
sofe_crisis.10.name: "Power Overwhelming."
sofe_crisis.10.desc: "Critical Alert! Massive fleets are emerging from the Outer Gates across the galaxy. Our stations guarding them have mysteriously vanished and have been replaced by the invader's own massive station-like construct. Reports indicate that all other Outer Gates have also been unsealed and similar fleets are spotted.\n\nThe invader's fleets bear striking similarities to the fallen precursor's designs, yet are notably larger and significantly more advanced, with distinct white motif."
sofe_crisis.10.a: "Alert all commands! Red Alert!"



sofe_crisis.10.playoe.desc: "And thus do we call the might of the Stellarborne upon this galaxy once again. As per usual procedure, they have taken over all Outer Gates and all stations guarding them. Given that we have already proven ourselves in the past, this recreation of the events should prove trivial for us to surpass once again."
sofe_crisis.10.a.playoe: "The Light will grant us strength."

##When the OE first broadcasts their return to the Galaxy to normal peeps
origin_diplo_header_2: "The Stellarborne"
sofe_crisis.15.1.desc: "Vaa'di. Denizens of this galaxy, pay great attention for a great tournament will now begin.\n\nWe are the Stellarborne, chosen of the Light and champion of the Omega.\n\nThere is a great threat looming on the horizon that will soon threaten all lives across this metaverse. A contest must thus, be held to determine new champions that will serve as each galaxy's representative for the Order of Light. Each empire will participate, or abdicate and join as spectators. Please make your choices."
##When the OE first broadcasts their return to the Galaxy to FEs
sofe_crisis.15.1.desc.fallen: "As foretold, we are coming to bring harmony to this realm. We are extremely displeased that the Fallen Empires of this galaxy is no different from the ones we triumphed over. But you are different, [root.GetName]. Though Your efforts to safeguard this galaxy has been mediocre at best, you show signs of change, change that is not visible to other fallen empires.\n\nWe speak to the one behind this change now, if you wish to see this empire changed for good, you will rise up to the challenge and earn the ascension."
##When the OE first broadcasts their return to the Galaxy to EE
sofe_crisis.15.1.desc.eternal: "Vad'ikos, mighty §Y[Root.GetName].§!\n\nWe the §YStellarborne§! of the Order of Light welcomes you to this galaxy...or should we say, to Stellaris? We have observed your arrival into this dimension and are impressed with your empire's capabilities.\n\nThough we do not know what plans do you have for this little galaxy, we offer you a permanent position in the Order of Light, as part of the Champions that will safeguard this entire reality. Should you be interested, display your determination and valor in this contest, and emerge victorious by taking the fight to the heart of our bastion!"


##When the OE first broadcasts their return to the Galaxy - Asking them stuffs
sofe_crisis.15.a: "Wait a minute, who or what are you again?"
sofe_crisis.15.a.response: "Ah, where were our manners. Let us introduce ourselves properly them.\n\nWe are the §YStellaborne§!, champion of the Order of Light, serving under Omega, an outer entity that safeguards the universes. Though we would like to speak more of our designs, much of it will not make much sense to you at the moment.\n\nFor now, understand that we are here on a mission to organize this tournament to find worthy empires to join our cause."

sofe_crisis.15.b: "Your ships look awfully similar to the fallen empires."
sofe_crisis.15.b.response: "Precisely, for both the ships used in this tournament and the one employed by the fallen empires are based upon the ancient precursor designs made by the Omega themselves. The empires you referred to as the Fallen Ones were once part of the four great guardian empires of all universes.\n\nLong ago, the Omega saw potential in each of them. They were uplifted and provided purposes to safeguard the galaxies. Their empires once spread across the stars far and high.\n\nThe coming of the Shadow saw an end to that, for they were soon corrupted and the unity that once bound them together were shattered. What was once a glorious power, now a tiny little spark. Once a dragon, now a tiyanki, existed only to weed off defenseless gas giants.\n\nTheir times have long passed, it is time for a new champion to rise up and safeguard the universes. Will you be that champion? Only your will and strength will tell."

sofe_crisis.15.c: "What is this "Contest" about and why?"
sofe_crisis.15.c.response: "To expand and bolster the Order of Light, and enlight all beings to higher existences. But in order for you to understand the true importance of this contest, an explanation of the past events will be required.\n\nIn the past, the Omega have established the First Order of Light, a grand society between various empires under one unity. Each empire holds control over vast territories, far beyond concepts of galaxies, and they compete with each other for greater claim. The nature of the system allowed order and chaos to be balanced with every conflict being carefully controlled and maintained.\n\nUnfortunately, we have discovered that the system was flawed due to the lack of greater clarity. The First Order of Light were mostly unaware of Omegan's existence or its true power.\n\nWhen the Shadows attacked, they were caught off guard and Omegan's ability to communicate with the Order was compromised. The Order fell apart without any strong figures to support them. The Fallen Ones who were supposed to protect all, failed in their tasks and instead propagated the damage further with their corrupted ambitions.\n\nBut the universes are still yet in danger, the corruptions of the Shadow looms over the horizon and thus must the Second Order of Light be borne anew. To this end, the Omega seeks a different approach, to ascend all members of the Order as beings borne of the stars themselves, the Stellarborne. But only through valor and devotion to one's fate will render them worthy of the mantle. We, as senior members of such Stellarbornes are given the tasks to seek out like-minded civilizations, to bring one amongst each galaxy to the fold. Only together can we seek to thwart the Shadow and restore balance to this realm."

sofe_crisis.15.d: "What is this "Shadow?""
sofe_crisis.15.d.response: "We do not know its true name, but we know that it is an ancient entity that sought to bring all beings into part of itself. It has sabotaged the Omega's great plans, destroyed the harmony and order within the cosmos and engineered the first great war.\n\nEven now the Omega is engaged in battle with the Shadow, and we must do what we can to ward off its corrupted minions.\n\nOnly those under the protection of Light can hope to withstand the overwhelming force of the Shadow. Only by becoming a Champion may one claims destiny as truly their own."

sofe_crisis.15.e: "We will speak later."
################# Asking as Genocidals
sofe_crisis.15.swarm.a: "More food? WE HUNGER"
sofe_crisis.15.swarm.a.tooltip: "Ah, so this galaxy has been infested with yet another depriving swarm. We could easily end you right here and now, but the tenants of the Order demands you be given a chance to change your ways or test your strengths. Should you doubt our capabilities, seek out our vessels, and prove yourselves worthy of your arrogance."
sofe_crisis.15.terminator.a: "Are you organics? We can't detect your life signals"
sofe_crisis.15.terminator.a.tooltip: "Yet another machine too primitive in its design...this universe seems to be littered with them somehow.\n\nNo matter, we will tolerate your flawed designs for now, since it may improve over time. Know that the form you see before you is only a projection that best serves this contest, you will find no concept of organics nor machines in the Light, your directives are ultimately flawed."
sofe_crisis.15.purifier.a: "Yet another heretics to be purged!"
sofe_crisis.15.purifier.a.tooltip: "Another overzealous fanatic...why must every galaxy be filled with the likes of you somewhere? Be glad that we are not permitted to show you the baselessness of your so-called beliefs."
################# Asking as FEs
sofe_crisis.15.fallen.a: "You...are real..?But that's not possible..."
sofe_crisis.15.fallen.a.response: "We are more real than you will ever be. You know who we are and what we represent. The Omega hold powers over the metaverse, simple confinements will not deter them.\n\nYour ancestors were given a chance to be better...to bring peace and prosperity to the universes that they so hardly fought for.\n\nBut what have you and your ancestors been doing all this time? For generations your kind have brought nothing but pointless destruction. Millions of worlds were consumed by rage and fire, countless civilizations destroyed in your mad quest for power.\n\nAnd yet you refuse to even accept responsibilities, deny the galaxies the healing they needed in their most hours of need. And worst of all, you have failed to even achieve your dreams of ascension, yet you still cling to your false sense of superiority. Have you forgotten your ancestor's very reasons to rebel against us in the first place? Where was the fire and determination in seeking powers beyond? The once glorious star, now hiding like rocks barely with any territories.\n\nHow can you be so blinded? Can you not see what your civilization has become? Your continued existence serves to only damage the health of this galaxy further and further.\n\nProve your strengths in this battle, and perhaps your position as the guardians may yet be restored."

sofe_crisis.15.fallen.b: "This "Contest" is pointless. Let the past die."
sofe_crisis.15.fallen.b.response: "Pointless? Have you not heed our words? We WERE once one of those you readily dubbed "primitives", we believed in your slanders and lies. We thought the endless chaos, the cold depths of space and loss of innocent lives part of nature. That your decrepit empires stood against the tests of time. But no, now we see the truth, you were once the guardians of this realm and have failed the Omega in their greatest hours of need. Your ancestors conspired to petty rebellions that shattered the metaverse itself. For over 20,000 years your ancestors wrecked destruction on all creation, divided the universes, tore down the very star that united us all.\n\nLet the past die? Yes, you are the past, it is time for you to see the present, and the future that is to come."

sofe_crisis.15.fallen.c: "What even are your goals?! We are tired of hearing it."
sofe_crisis.15.fallen.c.response: "Everything you needed to know about them has already been recorded by your ancestors. Has the Keystone not shed any insights? Or have you fallen so far as to forget the technology of your own designs, and how to access the full archive of the Keystone.\n\nWhy do you seek to know the Omega's purposes when you fail to even fulfill your own? Your ancestors were given all the knowledge needed to ascend. Yet they gave in to greed, refusing to become better. Your ancestors wanted power, but power without purpose is meaningless.\n\nPower without purpose leads to corruption. And you, fallen ones, are corrupted to the very core."

sofe_crisis.15.fallen.d: "The Omega lied to you! This conversation is over!"
sofe_crisis.15.fallen.d.response: "Lies? The only one lying to you is your own ancestors. The very worlds that you resided...have you forgotten who was it that nourished them? Was it not the Omega who created these ideal perfect worlds that your species could evolve? Was it not THEM who taught you how to fly your first spacecraft, to witness the birth of stars?\n\nYour entire societies, your entire achievements...even your ships and technologies were all products of your ancestor's desire to emulate the Omega.\n\nYou cannot deny the truth, [root.GetName]. Your ancestors have never achieved ascension, nor did you.\n\nWe too were once lied, by those like you. Our galaxy once hosted parasites like you. We surpassed them, and the denizens of this galaxy will surpass you."

################# Asking as EEs

sofe_crisis.15.eternal.a: "Hello there"
sofe_crisis.15.eternal.a.response: "Hi."

sofe_crisis.15.eternal.b: "What is your plans for this primitive galaxy?"
sofe_crisis.15.eternal.b.response: "Uhh, you know what? We'll call back to you later, the Omega hasn't told us what we are allowed to tell empires like yourselves yet. Come back later when Chiru added more contents. Is your mod even working?"

sofe_crisis.15.eternal.c: "You do not fear we may challenge your authority?"
sofe_crisis.15.eternal.c.response: "Nah, if you did, Chiru will just make us more OP than you anyway."

sofe_crisis.15.eternal.d: "Bye."

sofe_crisis.15.1.desc.oe: "Vad'ikos, [root.GetName].\n\n\n"§YChampions of the noble [root.GetName]. We see your reminiscence of your past galaxy has not dull your edge. You summon us now, in this great moment to recreate the glorious triumph that you once achieved, have you not?"
##Speaking to OE as OE
sofe_crisis.15.oe.a: "What about the other galaxies?"
sofe_crisis.15.oe.a.response: "§Y"Galaxy A-0317 failed the test entirely after the supposed champion became too overhyped and threatened to eat us. It was a devouring swarm so you get the idea. Galaxy C-6412 was able to disable one of the Stellar Worlds, but unfortunately gets stomped hard after a Honor Guard fleet was told to move forward to retaliate...come to think of it, maybe that may have been overkill?\n\nGalaxy U-1337 was able to successfully passed the test, but said they wanted to try again with a higher difficulty, so we transported them to a universe back in time and sets the Challenge Mode to Deathwish. They died horribly to the first wave afterwards.\n\nGalaxy T-4123 was able to pass the test after they asked their gods to give them physical invincibility. We let it slide, but warned them that such tricks will not work against the Shadows.\n\nGalaxy O-0101, filled with machines managed to pass all the tests legitimately, as well as Galaxy N-9416 who formed a big federation and managed to win by sacrificing enough fodders for bigger ships. The leader of the federation became the champion and left the federation afterwards and proceeded to destroy everyone else who was in the federation. I guess that's one way to maintain order?"§!"
sofe_crisis.15.oe.b: "Actually, we just want to hang out."
sofe_crisis.15.oe.b.response: "We understand, we too wish to spend more time with other champions, but the Order of Light needs to expand if it is to survive against the coming onslaught. Rather than talking about our pasts or futures, why not settle instead in action? Let us embrace combat once again!"
sofe_crisis.15.oe.c: "What news from the Omega?"
sofe_crisis.15.oe.c.response: "The Omega and some of the Order are already engaged with the Shadow and its corrupted minions. They are counting on us to hone our skills and further find worthy champions to join the fight.\n\nFortunately, we have ample time, for the Shadow itself is nowhere to be found, and our current efforts are proving effective."
sofe_crisis.15.oe.d: "Yes, let the battle be joined then!"
sofe_crisis.15.oe.d.response: "Excellent! Though given that you have already won the fight as mortals, you may find that the current parameter for this fight will be of much less challenge now that you wield the weapons of Light as well.\n\nSo show us what you have learned, strike with the fury and zeal worthy of the Omega!"

sofe_crisis.730.fallen.a.response: "Very well then, [root.GetName]. Let the stars be the witnesses, today we absolve you of all the crimes of your ancestors. You are a Tora'yoh no longer. You will begin your journey anew. You have been forgiven in our eyes, but will the galaxy that which you have wronged will forgive you as well? We will see."

##Asking OE questions
sofe_crisis.550.b: "We still have many more questions."
sofe_crisis.550.b.response: "Patience, young one. Focus on the current events first, we will have plenty of times for questions later, of which we are certain you will have many.\n\nBut know that this is not for our entertainment regardless of how it may seem.\n\nThere is a great threat lurking in the shadows, and we all must prepare for it."

sofe_crisis.550.c: "What about the Fallen Empires?"
sofe_crisis.550.c.response: "Considering they have massively failed in their tasks to fulfill their duties. They too must participate to reclaim their ascension.\n\nUnfortunately, we can feel their delusions seeping into their blackened hearts. They do not believe in us anymore, or the importance of their intended roles. It is likely that they will seek to resist us, simply because they are too arrogant and too self-assured to understand the truths before them.\n\nAlas, fate is such a cruel mistress. Even we cannot save these poor souls from their doomed future. Perhaps they may succeed in another universe?\n\nWe wish it could end differently. We wish we could be as heartless as they thought we were, to alter their fates directly, deny them their own destinies for our own personal gains.\n\nBut such is not our nature, this is a burden that we all must endure. For if we do not have faith in them, our children, how can anyone else?"

sofe_crisis.550.ask_fallen_gone: "It appears the Fallen One has been defeated."
sofe_crisis.550.ask_fallen_gone_response: "A tragic, yet foreseen outcome. Perhaps had we been more careful...more understanding of them, this would not come to pass. Alas, for all our powers and knowledge, there is still much we do not understand about how mortals think. Was it a mistake to utilize the Caretakers to understand them, rather than trying to do that ourselves?\n\nWould the Great Question be found and answered within these many mistakes we have made? We can only hope that these poor children will find success in another universe, then they may rejoin us, and tells us of their great triumphs."

origin_fallen_empires_awakening.5.desc: "The sudden arrival of the Stellarborne have not gone unnoticed by the fallen empires. The news of their return to the galactic stage prompted a massive panic amongst the ruling powers of the §H[From.GetSpeciesName]§!. They know what is about to begin, and have thus reawakened. Their warships are assembled and their leaders prepare for the worst. They have issued galaxy-wide statements, calling others to join them in defiance to this new threat."

##FE Spiritualist
fallenorigin.1.desc_66: "It cannot be! The false gods have returned! How can this be?\n\nDo not heed their words of heresy, [root.owner.species.GetNamePlural], for the false gods bring nothing but lies and deceits. Their second coming will bring nothing but ruin and destruction. The Order of Light, and this tournament is nothing but a lie, a facade for the false gods to slowly consume your souls, they feed on our sufferings, our very struggles.\n\nPreserve your spiritual purity by uniting under our font, the Shroud will guide us to victory. It is the only truth that matters! This we [from.GetName] commands as your guardian!"
##FE Xenophile
fallenorigin.1.desc_67: "Impossible! Someone has broken the seals!? What have the Gatekeepers been doing!? Useless pile of junks, we shouldn't have trusted anything made by those idiotic materialists!\n\nListen carefully, [root.GetSpeciesName]! For this is a grave matter, of a galactic...no...of a universal scale!. The False Order will seek to intoxicate all that submits to it with its ridiculous claims.\n\nWe the [from.GetName] are charged with the protection of this galaxy, NOT the others. Neither we or you should be concerned with that which is not in our jurisdictions. We should not have to suffer for the False Order's inability to fulfill its own duty!.\n\nCome, [Root.GetName], you must join us! Only together can we stop the evils of tyranny and preserve our galaxy's independence!"
##FE Xenophobe
fallenorigin.1.desc_68: "Once again we are correct. Some dumb fools have unlocked the seal, what a surprise. Had the other precursors do their jobs properly this would not happen! They thought our ways were "evil", that eradicating all the xeno filths would be too extreme. Now look at what their stupidity has brought us.\n\n[Root.GetName], know that you stand little chances against the Elders or us. We offer you a chance to be free of pain, to die by our hands, and be forever freed from all suffering.\n\nIf you choose to fight the Elders, know that there are fates worse than death! The Elders do not seek to kill, they will keep you alive, subject you to this pointless war again, and again and again.\n\nIf we, who are their most favored children, are not worthy in their eyes, then none ever will be, that is the truth the Elders refuse to acknowledge."
##FE Materialist
fallenorigin.1.desc_69: "What the...?\n\nThe Outer Gates are functioning again? This cannot be! Our calculations stated the seals will be effective for another 100 years...unless..of course!\n\nSome fools must have prematurely disabled the seals. Blasted! Where are the Gatekeepers! Useless machines!  We should have limited all your idiot's technologies to nothing but red lasers.\n\nWe assume you have already received the messages of the Elders, [root.GetName]. We cannot believe that after all these times, they are still hellbent on denying the truth. All their talks about metaverses and stuffs? Just childish and immature claims that cannot be proven. If they are as powerful as they claim to be, they'd have already won this war already. Our theorists suggest that they are simply an extra dimensional empire, not any of their pretentious claims.\n\nJoin us, together we will beat some logics into their brains, [root.GetName]."
##Asking FE questions
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin: "What do you know of the Stellarborne?"
fallenorigin.1.ask_light: "What kind of technologies are the Stellarborne using?"
##FE Xenophile - Progenitors?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_phile_response: "The False Order, you mean. Our archives suggest that they have existed since the dawn of creation itself, but that is most likely an exaggeration. We are fairly certain they were NOT called the Stellarborne by any previous records, where did you get this name from?.\n\nRegardless, the False Orders hold great powers over the cosmos, and their reach far exceed beyond the scope of this galaxy, at the very least. Seeing as this galaxy manages to survive just fine without their guidance, the False Order's claims of a greater threat is nothing but a facade, meant to coerce us into joining their causes. They may have created us, but they do not own us. We will drive them back. We have succeeded before, and we can do so again!"
##FE Xenophile - Light Energy?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_phile_response: "That we do not know, unfortunately. We the [from.GetName] do not concern ourselves with the technologies we do not understand. We take what we can understand and adapt it to our own, for better uses. The Materialists were the one who reverse-engineered most of the False Order's schematics. We believed that their inferior morality would cause them to misuse such powers, so we appropriated the designs and adapted them to our own.\n\nThat said, the replicated designs are severely outmatched by the False Order's vessels and technologies. To combat against them, massively superior numerical advantages will be required. That is all we can share."
##FE Xenophobe - Progenitors?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_phobe_response: "Get your stupid facts straight, you fools. They are called the Elders, not the Stellarborne. The Elder's powers grow beyond that of the stars. But to put it simple, back before any of you worms were even created, there were the Elders. The most powerful entities in the known metaverse. They were the ones that created, or rather restored us into existences. Those foolish precursors that tried to rival us? Those were restored to existence by the Elders as well. We the [from.GetName] are supposed to be their favored children, to stand amongst the elders. But all of you xeno filths have delayed our ascension. Everytime degenerates like you are spawned into this cursed galaxy, the Elders take interests in you.\n\nHad any of you never been born, we would not have to endure this miserable existence. None of you deserve the Elder's mercy. We will destroy and conquer you xeno filths as much as we can before the end. We will spare the Elders from having to endure your wretched existences, just as we had to."
##FE Xenophobe - Light Energy?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_phobe_response: "Ugh, what now? Stop speaking like you are some kind of precursor bookworm. Just call them the Elders. Its simpler that way, E-L-D-E-R-S, seriously you are all just trying to act smart with your clever namesa\n\nAnyway, you won't understand even if we try to explain it into your tiny brains. You are wasting our time and your energy, and the former is valuable. You are nothing but a stellar empire, you cannot comprehend the Elder's vast intellect over the Metaverse, so stop wasting our time."
##FE Spiritualist - Progenitors?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_spirit_response: "You wish to learn about the false gods? They were a hyper-advanced race that spanned across universes since the dawn of time. Our ancestors used to worship them as divine emissaries from the heavens, believing that the false gods had saved them from utter darkness in previous timelines. We followed in their footsteps, led to the promises that we will be ascended to their sides.\n\nWe were wrong, they have deceived us. They had no interests in helping us, they abandoned us in favor of searching for others they deemed more suitable for their twisted goals. But we don't need them anymore, for the Shroud has shown us the path.\n\nWe are the Holy Guardians of the Shroud, we will always prevail, for the true gods are with us, now and forever!"
##FE Spiritualist - Light Energy?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_spirit_response: "What they use are not something as mundane as material technologies. For indeed, the false gods command what is best described as purity of psionic powers. Even we know not of their true designs, but it matters not. The Shroud will grant us the powers we needed to drive them back, the gods have promised to come in our most dire hour of need.\n\nJoin us, and the powers of the true god will protect you."
##FE Materialist - Progenitors?
fallenorigin.1.ask_origin_mat_response: "First of, there has been no records of them ever referring to themselves as "Stellarborne", is this new information? But that aside, it is a complicated story. We know not of their origins, only of what they claimed to be. The Enigmas are perhaps the most advanced technological empire in this galaxy or perhaps even this universe. The technologies they possess are above what any of us can comprehend. Our engineers have learned a lot during their reign and we are now quite certain that all of their powers are simply a product of extremely advanced synthetic technologies, not some kind of cosmic or arcane powers most superstitious empires think.\n\nWe are now very confident that most of the stories in the past were products of our ancestor's overhyped in the Enigma's Marvels. If you join us now, we may allow one of your most gifted scientists to learn a glimpse of their technologies...once we determiend the level of knowledge deemed appropriate for lesser empires such as yours of course."
##FE Materialist - Light Energy?
fallenorigin.1.ask_light_mat_response: "Stellarborne? Is that what they present themselves to you? We must get to the bottom of this later.\n\nRecords indicated that the Enigmas used what was then known as "§YLight Energy!", a hypothetical energy source of unrivaled potency used exclusively by the Enigmas. Unfortunately, we do not know how it works nor can we reproduce it ourselves for verification. Some idiots said it is related to psionics, but that's just nonsenses. We have clearly seen how psionic powers operate before, and the Enigma's power far eclipse psionics.\n\nIgnore this pointless tournament, think of the possibilities. Outsmart the Enigma, do as we did; make them trust you, then learn from them. Strike when they least expected it, take what should be ours. Then we will decide whether you are fit to keep such knowledge once the crisis is over."

Many stations and Ringworld Units had to be uninstalled as observed until this exact time period. We anticipated that our power reserves will reach critical level soon. Only the masters may save us...but now we are forced to fight them.\n\nThere is no future for us save for the salvation through the master's mercy. We hope we are still worthy of it."

fallenorigin.2.c: "Were you not built to fight the Contingency?"
fallenorigin.2.c.tooltip: "This special question is revealed through SOPHIA's encryption into the Caretaker's History. Though the Caretakers have seen being used by many ancient empires, there were multiple records of the units being used to fight against a machine crisis known as The Contingency.

sofe_crisis.402.desc.playoe: "Just like in the past, by dealing enough superficial damage to the Worldspheres, the conditions for nullifying the reinforcement cycle has been satisfied."
sofe_crisis.402.a: "Show no quarter!"
sofe_crisis.402.b: "Victory draws near!"
sofe_crisis.402.playoe: "A trivial matter."

sofe_crisis.403.desc: "The last of the Worldspheres have been disabled. The Stellarborne will no longer reinforce any fleets from them. The Tournament of Power will soon reach its conclusion."
sofe_crisis.403.desc.playoe: "The last of the Worldspheres have been disabled. The grand finality is at hand."
sofe_crisis.403.a: "For [root.GetName]! For [root.GetRulerName]!"
sofe_crisis.403.b: "Soon we will expose their lies and consume them."
sofe_crisis.403.playoe: "There is no doubt!"

sofe_crisis.405.desc: "Impressive! You have managed to disable one of the Worldspheres. You have met our expectations!\n\nThe Tourmanet is finally coming together. Come, let us see whether you have the will to carry on, we will be waiting!"
sofe_crisis.405.desc.edge: "You have managed to disable one of our Worldspheres. Quite impressive, for one so blinded by bloodlust. But we are patient, perhaps at the end of this test you may yet change. There is always a better path, young one. Never forget that."
sofe_crisis.405.desc.playoe: "Excellent Work, fellow champions. You have made quick work on this Worldsphere. This match will soon be over!"
sofe_crisis.405.a: "What will happen now?"
sofe_crisis.405.a.response: "As per the rule, no more fleets will be coming from this vantage point and a great amount of Light Energies will be given to you. Take this as an advantage, [root.GetName]. As we deploy fewer and fewer fleets, soon you will be able to overcome our staged defenses and claim victory over this little tournament. Then what comes next, will be a marvel you will certainly cherish."

sofe_crisis.406.desc.edge: "Your bloodlust and tenacity has served you well. You have managed to triumph over our stations. Now let us see if such adrenaline will carry you through. But know that you will find no satisfaction in the end, so long as you remain on this broken path."

sofe_crisis.406.playoe: "Let's settle this!"



#### THIS PART NEEDS PARTIAL REWRITES TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE OE WANTS, AND ABOUT POTENTIAL THREATS OF THESAN. AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THEY CANNOT ACTUALLY BE KILLED.

sofe_crisis.501.desc: "Well done, [root.GetName].\n\nNa'nutu, you have proven that there is strength and hope for this galaxy. The Tournament of Power has concluded. You are indeed a formidable power, worthy of the Champion status.\n\nWill you take up this mantle, become one as us, join the Order of Light, and ascend beyond the stars?"
sofe_crisis.501.desc.edge: "Impressive, [root.GetName].\n\nYou have proven that your empire has determination and will to survive, even if its for warped and corrupted ideologies.\n\nWe urge you to reconsider your stance, think of the trials you have endured, know that this is but a prelude for things to come. If you are to stand against the coming tide, you will do well to heed our words.\n\nThis is your last chance to do the right thing, We advise you to take it."
sofe_crisis.501.desc.servitor: "Well done, [root.GetName].\n\nNa'nutu, you have proven that there is strength and hope for this galaxy. The Tournament of Power has concluded. You are indeed a formidable power, worthy of the Champion status.\n\nHowever, there are certain issues that we must discuss, regarding your current directives. You are a Rogue Servitor, programmed by your creators to serve and pamper organics. You have taken a long dive towards that directive, and have in many instances, denied organics of their potential by excessively pampering their every desire. This goes against our concepts, as life is not worth living if it has no progression. Life without destiny is an illusion. A lie plain and truth.\n\nIf you are to transcend past your old codes, you must be willing to cast aside your directives, to truly become one with the Light. This is your final test, can you surpass your creator's flawed designs?."
sofe_crisis.501.desc.playoe: "Well done, fellow champion.\n\nYou have not lost your touch after all. This content may perhaps be a little trivial for you now. Perhaps you are ready to join us in the fight against the Shadow, or do you still seek to practice some more of your powers?"
sofe_crisis.501.playoe.a: "We still have things to do here."
sofe_crisis.501.playoe.a.response: "Very well. We'll be in touch."
sofe_crisis.501.playoe.b: "We are finished here, let us away."
sofe_crisis.501.playoe.b.response: "Excellent, let us return to the Omega and render our all to the fight!"


sofe_crisis.501.a: "What exactly will happen if we accept?"
sofe_crisis.501.a.response: "By ascending to the Light, your existences across all dimensions will be merged. You will become a unique creation, and no entities will be able to corrupt or alter you. This is the essence of light, to cross beyond mortal limits.\n\nOnce the process is done, what is left of this galaxy will be transformed into a unique domain of your own. Everything within it will be yours to reshape. As a newborn champion, you will learn to understand its power, and explore your new reach. Once you deem yourselves ready, call upon us and together, we will take the fight to the Shadow."

sofe_crisis.501.a.fallenask: "What about the fallen empires?"
sofe_crisis.501.a.fallenask.response: "They have had their chances, and they have failed. Once you ascend, they will simply become no more than reflections of your new power. They will most likely reject your authority, deal with them as you see fit.\n\nPerhaps in another universe, they will surpass their repeated cycles of failures, but their journey in this one has come to an end."

sofe_crisis.501.b: "And what if we refuse?"
sofe_crisis.501.b.response: "Should you refuse, the knowledge and powers that we have taught you so far will remain with you. The Tournament will continue on in other universes and timelines. What you plan to do afterwards is of no importance to us.\n\nBut you should be aware that if another version of you in other universes accept the offer, your existence, along with all other versions of you, will be merged with the victor. And should the Shadow come for your galaxy, we cannot offer our full protection, unlike us, there will be no warning, no fight. When it comes, only by the protection of the Light will you be shielded from its grip, both here and beyond.\n\nConsider carefully, [root.GetName]. Will you put your trust in us, see for yourselves the echoes of truth, or leave this stage blinded and close-minded."

sofe_crisis.501.c: "You seem not as strong as you claim to be."
sofe_crisis.501.c.response: "What you defeat is simply a specific arrangement of fleets designed specifically for the purpose of this tournament. As we have told, the nature of this test is not about the amount of ships one empire can throw, it is about the will and determination to see this fight through to the end. It is mortal's nature to bask in one's achievements and be drunk with the sudden increase in power. To be addicted to the unfathomable gain in strength.\n\nBut do not be fooled. Had we come to you with the goal of annihilation, there would be no contest, no fight. It would have been a swift, silent and deadly execution. Yours is a powerful empire, your will to survive is a great gift. But your blindness leaves you vulnerable to false temptations.\n\nIf you will not trust in our words, then leave it at that. Do not tempt our wrath further. We will suffer to risk an empire of your caliber falling in the clutches of the Shadow. Do not force our hands."

origin_tech.6500.name: "The Stellarborne speaks!"
origin_tech.6500.desc: "Va'dikos, mighty [root.GetName]. Now that you have risen to become the champion of this galaxy. It is time for you to learn how to tap into the power of the Light itself.\n\nTo this end, you will attempt to recreate the Arkship itself from your memory. Focus your mind, and project images of its existence back into reality. Once done, you'll master the necessary skills to command the Light."
origin_tech.6500.a: "Yes, brothers."

origin_tech.6500.ask.a: "What is the "Shadows" exactly?"
origin_tech.6500.ask.a.explain: "The Shadows are the Omega's arch-nemesis, and the catalyst that ushers the entirety of the first Insurrection of which are known to many as the First Progenitor War. Though as of now, we do not know where it comes from, or what schemes it has. We do not even know whether it's a singular being, or a group of individuals with a particular interest. We only know that they have corrupted a sizable portion of the Spiritualist Holy Guardians, one of our first prodigies. The entire nation was consumed into its service - akin to a Hive Mind. The populations of the entire empire still somewhat retain their wills, but they have been robbed of their destinies and fates, and exist only to serve the Shadow.\n\nThe Shadows then struck at the Omega from behind while we were battling against the fallens. With our forces spread too thin and the Omega's tenants being much less militaristics at the time, they were ill-prepared to fight against the Shadow properly, but we could hold our grounds without much casualties.\n\nIt is only when we learned that the Shadow was to participate in the assault against the Outer Cluster, which at the time was still early in its exploration that we had to pull in majority of our fleets to ensure its safety.\n\nAs you may have learned from the archives in the keystone, it was a trap that led to our exile.\n\nNevetheless, it seemed the Shadows are not here...yet. We know not where it could be, but we can still faintly feel its presence. It will return, and we all must be ready for it.\n\nYour current fleets may not be enough, so we wish to bolster your forces with this gift when the time comes."

origin_tech.6500.ask.b.explain: "Of course, understand that up until now, all ships that you encountered, including the Arkship were mere projections of the Light.\n\nYour empire has proven to be worthy and your strengths not wanting.\n\nOnce you complete this training, you will understand just how much we have been holding back against the galaxy in the tournament."
origin_tech.6500.ask.c: "What will happen to us afterwards?"
origin_tech.6500.ask.c.explain:  "Once done, you'll cross into the realm of new possibilities, to the path of Light that we all share. You are free to exercise your new powers and learn to master it as you see fit.\n\nThough we hope that you will join us in the fights against the Shadow once you are ready, the decision is up to you. The purpose of the Tournament is two-fold, to give empires such as you the ability to truly control your own destiny, and to deny the Shadow off more minions. Know that regardless, we are all family now, and our bonds will never be broken."

origin_tech.6500.a.response: "Excellent.\n\nKnow that the Arkship will be equipped with the Monolith Beam. This arcane weapon is designed as a means to keep the galaxy in peace, while sparing the troublemakers from the flames. By focusing the Omni-Matrix Cerekath Memory Crystal along the Six Lens of Fate, the Monolith Beam can safety transfer entire worlds within the very virtual worlds of the Omni-Matrix.\n\nThis allows us to remove civilizations that pose great threats to the rest of the galaxy while sparring them from true annihilation.

But they were not the first, it appeared that they have been deliberately planted here by an unseen hand.\n\nThe Omega's creation was unique, they have journeyed across realities, yet they never found traces of themselves in any other parallel universes, nor any civilizations that bore any similarities to theirs. For they were born with much knowledge already within their thoughts, great powers were already theirs to command. The process of evolutions that was the norm of every lifeform, did not exist for them. They were simply born already perfect...in a way.\n\nImagine that your races woke up, already having the knowledge of your current era, yet knew nothing about your pasts. There was no evolution, no trace of previous history, you were simply born like you are now.\n\nThus, the pursuit of the Great Question was born. The Omegans are eager to learn of the pasts and began exploring across the cosmos. That goal still resonates within them now and ever, but such goal must wait for the threat of the Shadow must first be eliminated."
sofe_post.1.b: "What's the languages you used during the Tournament?"
sofe_post.1.b.response: "Ah, it is actually a made-up set of words we used to sound mysterious, there's not really anything special to it. It's actually quite fun to come up with new, interesting words for every new Tournaments. The truth is, as the Stellarborne, we do not make use of languages at all. It is a concept that is only relevant for our previous selves. We are gifted with the knowledge to communicate with each other through our wills, and all of our powers, equipment and technologies are made to reflect such systems. Our artifacts and powers speak to us as much as we speak to them\n\The concept of things such as written texts and records were in fact alien to the Omegans. Remember our past technologies? So many buttons to press...yet they all do the same thing."
sofe_post.1.c: "What exactly is your goal?"
sofe_post.1.c.response: "Eat a lot of foo...to find and answer the Great Question. We will explain about it later when Chirumiru is not busy playing other games."
sofe_post.1.d: "You mentioned about metaverses. Can you explain?"
sofe_post.1.d.response: "It's bigger than multiverses. We will talk about it later."
sofe_post.1.e: "What is the Outer Cluster and the Gates exactly?"
sofe_post.1.e.response: "It's a gate. Sorry, we will add more later when Chirumiru decides to write about it."
