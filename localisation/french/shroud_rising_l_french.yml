It had managed to remain relatively unknown, except for a few adventure seekers, due to its location in a remote and perilous part of the planet. Even these individuals seem to know very little, though it's believed that its age surpasses well over a million years. The unusual black material it was built with has withstood the test of time, but now it glows an ominous and chilling crimson.\n\nWhat was once a beautiful, if not harrowing, ancient wonder, now causes panic as its psionic activity has risen ever since the §MEye of Terror§! was unleashed."

What they discovered within the main chamber was what remained of a massive unusual Monolith, having recently collapsed - though still faintly glowing. It's clear following the power surge that it was too damaged to remain stable and the black edifice crumbled.\n\nFollowing an initial analysis, all our team could conclude was that it was made up of a unknown stone infused with psionic energy.

Not only have we learned the purpose of these ominous structures, but we've learned the secrets to their construction.\n\nThe ancient empire who built these §PMonoliths§! was a large martial nation, known for its fearsome warrior caste and powerful psionic priests. They regarded the §MShroud§! as a dangerous tool to be used only by the most revered and experienced psionic individuals within their society. Records seem to show that they began constructing these §PMonoliths§! in order to protect themselves from a rival, younger psionic empire that held opposite views - for them psionic power was a right for any soul gifted with the connection.  This rival empire would use their connection to create §MShroud§! rifts that began to devastate the martial empire and nearly brought it to its knees.\n\nThey began to build these obelisks with §LBlackstone§!, a type of stone found deep within a planets' crust and infused with psionic energy. When built and activated, they act as a conduit for psionic energy and harnesses it into an aura-like shield around a solar system.\n\nThese powerful monuments helped turn the tide of the war and its secrets are now ours."
