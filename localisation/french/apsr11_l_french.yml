Here is an extract from the logbook: \n§P«Our team has just come out of the hyperspace lane on the edge of the system, ready to explore it. Approaching one of the planets at a sublight speed, I've suddenly received a signal from one of the sensors. We scanned the planet - it turned out to have characteristics that are very similar to ones our own planets have. \nThe crew decided to examine it more closely using the onboard telescopes, and that is when we've discovered a peculiar red glow on the dark side of the planet. \nIs it caused by some kind of mineral? By some liquid or some gas? Maybe microogranisms? Or plants? But there's no point in contemplating. We'd already decided to land. Our pilot did so very skillfully. «Turn off the engines», «activate the «Perimeter» and all the external lights». And we are finally there»§!"

So what could it be? The sensors were displaying the local atmosphere characteristics - really close to what we have on our own planet. \nAt that moment our pilot informed us that he intended to reset the ship equipment to switch to the spare battery. Perhaps some connections  aren't right... The ship lights went off for a couple of seconds and switched on again. I felt like I had seen something and asked the pilot to mute the external lights»§!"

And one of them passed just by my face. They were living creatures... like insects... The local fireflies... But glowing red. That's what it actually was. The first inhabited planet in this system, dwelt by fireflies and no other known creatures. That was really a thing! \nWe've left a beacon with a mark.
