 # Time Lost Device
 gpm_time_lost_digsite:0 "À la recherche du temps"
 gpm_time_lost_digsite_desc:0 "Le temps sur cette planète semble changer et se déformer à des intervalles prévisibles. Quelque chose doit être la cause de cela."

  
 gpm_dig_site.10.name:0 "Lectures étranges"
 gpm_dig_site.10.desc:0 "Les lectures effectuées sur la planète indiquent que toutes les fluctuations temporelles proviennent d'un point situé quelque part dans l'hémisphère nord de ce monde. Il faudra un certain temps pour déterminer l'origine exacte de ces étranges distorsions temporelles. Bien que toutes les données indiquent que la source se trouve à un emplacement, dans le passé et dans un avenir proche, la source a été déplacée. Et avec le temps qui coule si fréquemment, il est difficile de déterminer son emplacement actuel."
  
 gpm_dig_site.11.name:0 "La boîte"
 gpm_dig_site.11.desc:0 "Nous avons trouvé l'emplacement actuel de la cause de ces distorsions temporelles. S'il y a une chose telle que courant sur ce monde de toute façon. Les fluctuations semblent provenir d'un étrange rectangle bleu à moitié enterré qui a été laissé sur cette planète. Nous essayons actuellement de pénétrer à l'intérieur."
  
 gpm_dig_site.12.name:0 "Le Doc"
 gpm_dig_site.12.desc:0 "Après plusieurs tentatives, nous avons finalement pu pénétrer dans cette étrange boîte bleue. Il semble être légèrement plus grand à l'intérieur que l'extérieur. À l'intérieur, au milieu de la boîte ou de la pièce, nous avons trouvé un étrange dispositif sphérique. Cet appareil semble avoir une influence temporelle relativiste sur les objets proches de lui. La boîte semble cependant avoir amplifié l'effet de manière substantielle, bien que de manière incontrôlable. \ NCertaines notes ont également été trouvées réparties sur les murs de cette boîte. La plupart ne font que dribbler le fait que le temps est une grosse boule de trucs hésitants et instables. Aucune mention d'un nom ou d'un propriétaire de cette boîte et la sphère. Sauf une note; qui a été signé avec 'Le Doc'."


 # Generic Precursor Digsite
 gpm_precursor_generic_digsite:0 "Precursor Expedition"
 gpm_precursor_generic_digsite_desc:0 "This world used to belong to an ancient precursor civilisation. We must prepare an expeditionary team to survey this world from the ground.\n\nFirst thing to do is find a suitable location and set up a forward expeditionary camp. Duo to the many dangers of this world, and possible autonomous defensive systems, this will not be an easy task."

 gpm_dig_site.100.name:0 "Base of operations"
 gpm_dig_site.100.desc:0 "The expedition team found a safe spot to set up camp. Additional equipment and personnel are being dropped off to the makeshift camp with small drop-ships. An expedition is now getting ready to search the nearby precursor ruins. "
 gpm_dig_site.100.a:0 "Excellent"

 gpm_dig_site.110.name:0 "Searching the unknown"
 gpm_dig_site.110.desc:0 "The expeditionary team has been sent out along a narrow path alongside the first outer ruins. This to, hopefully, avoid any surprises that may lie on the main path into the ruins. It will take some time before they enter the ruins."
 gpm_dig_site.110.a:0 "Understood"

 gpm_dig_site.120.name:0 "Old is an understatement"
 gpm_dig_site.120.desc:0 "The team has made it into the ruins and have found it to be quite safe.\n\nSeveral small artifacts have so far been discovered along the route the expeditionary team has taken. Trinkets, tools, but also small electronic devices. A cursory analysis reveals them to be over 100.000 years old!\n\nThe supplies of the team are running low, so they are returning to base camp. Meanwhile a secondary expedition team is heading out."
 gpm_dig_site.120.a:0 "Excellent find!"

 gpm_dig_site.130.name:0 "New Route"
 gpm_dig_site.130.desc:0 "Our secondary expedition team has found a few tunnel systems and has discovered they lead into a well-preserved six-sided chamber, possibly leading into a a bigger complex. The chamber has five other doors but they appear to be locked.\n\nTools and equipment are being brought in to assist in breaching the locked doors."
 gpm_dig_site.130.a:0 "Continue with caution!"

 gpm_dig_site.140.name:0 "We're in!"
 gpm_dig_site.140.desc:0 "We have finally breached one of the locked doors! It looks like this is a rather large complex, part of the ruins above perhaps. Our expedition team is splitting up into groups of two in order to more efficiently explore the chambers of this complex.\nWho knows what they'll find. Or what will find them.."
 gpm_dig_site.140.a:0 "Record everything!"

 # default
 gpm_dig_site.150.name:0 "Unnamed Ruins"
 gpm_dig_site.150.desc:0 "After an extensive search across the ruins the secondary expedition has recovered only a handful of artifacts. Some small devices, heirlooms and cultural artifacts as well as a single working data slate.\n\nMost of the data has been lost however, or has been corrupted, but fortunately we've managed to recover some technological data."
 gpm_dig_site.150.a:0 "A good find none the less."

 # power array
 gpm_dig_site.151.name:0 "Power Facility"
 gpm_dig_site.151.desc:0 "These appear to be the ruins of an old power facility. Throughout several of the chambers of this complex, energy relays and power arrays were discovered. Most of them in such a bad state there is little to be learned from them however. We did find an interesting terminal in one of the deeper chambers and have pulled some incredible information from it."
 gpm_dig_site.151.a:0 "Excellent discovery!"
 
 #  ship disign facilicy
 gpm_dig_site.152.name:0 "Ship Design Institute"
 gpm_dig_site.152.desc:0 "Within these ruins we've stumbled upon a series of connecting rooms filled with large holo-boards and 3D-Fabricators. Some of the boards still function, barely. Some attempts have been made to decipher the intricate and complex writing and equations on the boards. It appears to be early designs for a new ship, a large one at that. A lengthy colossal ship with 4 hanger bays and, what we think are, repair bays. This colossal ship, this 'juggernaut', was in the early stages of design before this facility was abandoned."
 gpm_dig_site.152.a:0 "Juggernaut sounds amazing"
 
 # orbital monitoring station
 gpm_dig_site.153.name:0 "Orbital Monitoring Station"
 gpm_dig_site.153.desc:0 "Every chamber of this buried facility is covered with monitors, holo-screens and virtualisation globes. They appear to have been used to monitor everything going into and out of orbit from this world. Billions of miniature satellites must have been used originally to watch everything on and around this world. Not much is left from those however.. The data storage units on some of these virtualisation globes should still be recoverable."
 gpm_dig_site.153.a:0 "So much surveillance.."
 
 # bunker
 gpm_dig_site.154.name:0 "Old Bunker"
 gpm_dig_site.154.desc:0 "The walls and ceilings of these chambers are extremely reinforced with neutronium and some kind of moving, or "living" metal. They seem to repair most of the damage our tools did to the doors after we opened them. There are signs of firefights and explosions inside of the chambers, but the walls, floors, doors and ceilings all appear to be in pristine condition. This complex must have been some kind of bunker or at least a very heavy fortified facility."
 gpm_dig_site.154.a:0 "Interesting!"
 
 # command center
 gpm_dig_site.155.name:0 "Command Center"
 gpm_dig_site.155.desc:0 "Deep within the series of chambers we stumbled upon a central large chamber. The walls lined up with monitors, communication devices, and also preserved carcases of dead aliens. In the centre of the room sits an empty throne surrounded by miniature monitors and various tubes, communication interfaces and small platforms full of intractable interfaces. This must have been some kind of command centre from where this precursor waged their wars."
 gpm_dig_site.155.a:0 "Recover the throne as well!"
 
 # crashed floating city
 gpm_dig_site.156.name:0 "Crashed City"
 gpm_dig_site.156.desc:0 "It didn't take long to realise the series of rooms and corridors we entered are part of a single large complex. When we tried to go further, we stumbled upon buried streets, transportation devices and entire buildings. This is an entire city! A crashed one like the ones found on this world. The devastation must have been tremendous, and the loss of life unimaginable. We're trying to salvage as much as we can before the rest of this place collapses on itself."
 gpm_dig_site.156.a:0 "A horrific discovery"
 
 # administrative hub
 gpm_dig_site.157.name:0 "H.U.B."
 gpm_dig_site.157.desc:0 "Most of the adjacent chambers are empty. Long ago abandoned by their original creators. All except one. It appears a central large computer is still there. The broken down machine bears the designation "H.U.B." and has been offline for thousands of years. It is believe this was the central unit, a 'mind' capable of running the entire complex autonomously. Not much data was recoverable, but we definitely did not leave empty handed."
 gpm_dig_site.157.a:0 "Excellent"
 
 # communication tower
 gpm_dig_site.158.name:0 "Communications Facility"
 gpm_dig_site.158.desc:0 "Dozens of single sectioned off units are spread across each chamber. Walls only half as high as the room. Each section has a small entrance and appears to be filled with a type of working station, monitor of some kind and various communication devices. Strangely enough in some of these workstations we found ancient intoxicating beverages, trace amounts of hallucinogenic substances or small pocket sized firearms. This appears to not have been a nice place to work, or perhaps the happiest place."
 gpm_dig_site.158.a:0 "How peculiar"
 
 # quantum databanks
 gpm_dig_site.159.name:0 "Quantum Databanks"
 gpm_dig_site.159.desc:0 "Endless rows of brightly lit databanks stretch out into these vast chambers. They each seem to have their own endless power units and are mostly still intact and running. Despite the layers of dust and rock on top of them. We're pulling as much data as we can from them."
 gpm_dig_site.159.a:0 "A great opportunity to learn"
 
 # abandoned fortress
 gpm_dig_site.160.name:0 "Impenetrable Fortress"
 gpm_dig_site.160.desc:0 "It didn't take long for our two man teams to keep running into each other in this ruined complex. It is a maze, a labyrinth, something far worse.. All paths cross, and all paths are dead ends. It seems like this complex uses miniature wormholes hidden behind reflector fields to trick and move intruders across the various entrances and dead ends of this complex. It'll take a while to map out all the routes, dead ends and wormholes, and get into the innards of this complex."
 gpm_dig_site.160.a:0 "I'm already confused"
 
 # escapee hideout
 gpm_dig_site.161.name:0 "Escapee's Hideout"
 gpm_dig_site.161.desc:0 "It's unknown what part of the prison complex this old place used to be. But it seemed to have been repurposed as a shelter or hideout for escaped prisoners. Dozens of discarded prison outfits, chains and destroyed tracking devices were found inside. Several propaganda manuals are also found across the hideout or shelter. All of them either burned or damaged. We're trying to salvage what we can from the devices and learn as much from the manuals."
 gpm_dig_site.161.a:0 "What a miserable place"
 
 # mining unit storage
 gpm_dig_site.162.name:0 "Mining Unit Storage"
 gpm_dig_site.162.desc:0 "Rows and rows of inactive derelict droids stand before us. Each chamber housing similar droids with different tools and configurations. After many hours of trying we have finally successfully connected to the positronic brain of one of the droids and have downloaded a large amount of data."
 gpm_dig_site.162.a:0 "Fascinating!"
 
 # weapons manufactory
 gpm_dig_site.163.name:0 "Weapons Manufactory"
 gpm_dig_site.163.desc:0 "Each chamber is filled with overlapping conveyor belts, pneumonic pressure plates and various robotic arms. Various types of weapon components and their finished or unfinished parts can be found throughout the facility. The various chambers seem to be a series of manufacturing steps for whatever weapon this facility produced so many millennia ago."
 gpm_dig_site.163.a:0 "Interesting!"
 
 # vaults
 gpm_dig_site.164.name:0 "Ancient Vaults"
 gpm_dig_site.164.desc:0 "Once we reached the inner chambers we discovered this was not just any complex. It was the vault itself. Many vaults to be precise. We're still analysing everything we found here, but the knowledge and resources left behind here will keep our scientist busy for generations."
 gpm_dig_site.164.a:0 "Amazing!"
 
 # burried crashed orbital
 gpm_dig_site.165.name:0 "Crashed Orbital"
 gpm_dig_site.165.desc:0 "The layout of these chambers indicate this used to be part of a large, flat complex with a surface. The chambers, in sets of three, all appear to be slightly higher in level the further you go in. This might mean this used to be part of a more circular super structure. It's theorised this could have been part of an orbital. A large, artificial world in the shape of a ring."
 gpm_dig_site.165.a:0 "Interesting theory"
 
 # outpost ruins
 gpm_dig_site.166.name:0 "Abandoned Outpost"
 gpm_dig_site.166.desc:0 "It looks like this was nothing more than an outpost. Few tools, containers and barely noteworthy amenities are spread out in this place. Some old devices and weapons have been found as well. It appears to have been abandoned in a hurry."
 gpm_dig_site.166.a:0 "Salvage what you can"
 
 # harbor warehouse
 gpm_dig_site.167.name:0 "Collapsed Warehouse"
 gpm_dig_site.167.desc:0 "Several large chambers were found to be full of containers. Many made from an unknown material. We were reluctant to open these, but the few we found already opened contained nothing more than generic tools and materials. After opening some of the ones in the back we've found some interesting devices and materials."
 gpm_dig_site.167.a:0 "Excellent discovery"
