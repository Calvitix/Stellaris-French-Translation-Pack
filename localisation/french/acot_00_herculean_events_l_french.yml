acot_herculean_development_chain: "The Herculean"
acot_herculean_development_chain_title: "The Herculean"
acot_herculean_development_chain_desc: "What is this mysterious, abandoned precursor project? What connection does it has with the modern era's colossi? Is it a new weapon, or simply baseless myths of the past?"

acot_herculean_poi.1: "Herculean Study"
acot_herculean_poi.1.name: "Herculean Study"
acot_herculean_poi.1.desc: "What is this Herculean? It has no physical evidence in our galaxy, and its details very vague. Perhaps SOPHIA-D can tell us more."

acot_herculean_events.1.name: "Everlasting Legacy"
acot_herculean_events.1.desc: "It has been sometimes since our precursor reimagination project started. Our most gifted scientists and architects have been working hard to decipher the ancient designs of the past using the data given by SOPHIA-D. Yet, there is one missing element. The colossi, thought to be used by the fallen empires as a mere platform for planetary destruction, has been described entirely different in the records.\n\nAccording to what we discovered so far, the actual design for this type of ship has never truly went beyond rough concepts. To call it a ship would be somewhat misleading, for this "Herculean" is described as an everlasting legacy, a means to which an empire can live on forever in a form of massive mobile megastructure that can run on its own.\n\nIf we wish to know more, we'll have to bring this topic to SOPHIA-D."

acot_herculean_events.1.a: "Then let's get to it right away."
acot_herculean_events.1.b: "We have more pressing concerns. Perhaps later."
acot_herculean_events.1.c: "Immortality is overrated. We do not need this."


acot_herculean_events.2.desc: "Ah yes. You're speaking of the Herculean Project. First conceptualized during the heat of the Ascension War period, it was designed with the goal of preserving one's everlasting legacy in mind. A mobile, combat-capable megastructure superstation that can outlive its own creators. Too bad, it never went past concepts so no one actually got to build one during that time. Would be impossible anyway, it was just ridiculous. There're other ways to preserve your legacy, one that doesn't involve so much grandoise."

acot_herculean_events.2.a: "So what is the design like?"
acot_herculean_events.2.a.response: "The Colossi you see the Fallen Empires use? That was essentially supposed to be its most inner core. Well, even that term would be generous, the one they eventually came up with was nothing more that a planet-killing platfoem with little self-defense capability. The actual design would have included at least multiple layers of the hulls, fully encased in powerful rings, each filled to the brim with weapon systems. Each capable of housing an entire civilization. And the most important part, is that true to its concept, each Herculean has its own mind and mission, to preserve the legacy of the ones who created it. It is not a ship, it is, by all accounts, a type of synthetic construct.\n\nIn terms of actual military capabilities, it can still perform the role of a colossus, but it can also construct ships, defend itself, provides support to the fleets and neutralize enemy fleet's firepower. Some concepts also enable it to generate its own resources, or even house an entire research complex. Doesn't really matter though, most of it is just pure fantasy. The scope and scale of the Herculean project is simply not feasible back then, and even more so now, with the galaxy being so small and so weak as it is."
acot_herculean_events.2.b: "Why did it never get past the drawing board?"
acot_herculean_events.2.b.response: "First off, the scale is nigh ridiculous. We're not talking about a star-sized mobile starbase here. The design was based off an ancient arkship of eld, one whose size easily dwarfed an entire galaxy. And that is probably not even its actual size. No empire, however strong back then, could amasss such a grand design with their limited resources and territory.\n\nSecondly, they are trying to preserve their legacy, but they can't actually figure out what is this legacy they want to pass down. The Ascension War left very little room for succeeding generations to even remember whom their ancestors were. Allegiances and heritages get changed and altered all the time, along with the history. They can scarcely write a proper history book within a decade old range with any modicum of accuracy, and they think to make an everlasting impression? It's kinda sad actually.\n\nThirdly, such a grand project would not escape people's attention. The Ascension War was a free-for-all game of thrones, where privacy did not exist. Had an empire tried to build one, it would be attacked and destroyed, or worse, repurposed by the enemies. It served no real immediate advantage in the raging war.\n\nFinally, very few could comes to term or entertain the idea that their empire and civilization woul die and only be remembered by a synthetic construct. They, in simpliest term, did not trust an artificial intelligence to fully uphold their precious idelogy and beliefs. A Peacekeeper Herculean, left for thousand of years, may become a symbol of fear and death. No one wants their legacy tarnished by something they do not have control over, or they just did not ever believe their empire would fall to begin with."
acot_herculean_events.2.c: "Has no one really tried to build one?"
acot_herculean_events.2.c.response: "Not in the ancient times, no. And no offense, such concept is beyond your current level of technology and power. That said, it is possible to optimize and modernize the design a bit so that it's a bit more feasible in this era. I cannot tell whether any other SOPHIA-Ds may have encouraged in other civilizations, but perhaps some kind of simplified, more logical version could have been built somewhere. You may be able to build one too, so long as you keep your expectations in check."
acot_herculean_events.2.d: "Let's make it happen then!"
acot_herculean_events.2.e: "Forget about it."
acot_herculean_events.2.e.response: "Perhaps, that is for the best. I mean, you should focus on conquering this galaxy first, then perhaps you can think about this legacy thing, yes?"

acot_herculean_events.3.desc: "You must be kidding. You cannot possibly think that an empire of your caliber is going to build something that is bigger than your whole galaxy as a ship?\n\nThen again, aside form the size issues, your empire should be able to easily deal with other problems that plagued the project in the past. Perhaps, that is the point of the Reimagination Project after all...\n\nVery well, if you are willing to lower its scale by a considerable degree, it should be able to create this everlasting legacy. Are you certain about this?"
acot_herculean_events.3.a: "You do not seem as enthusiastic like before."
acot_herculean_events.3.a.response: "You are not wrong. While I was never truly a fan of the Fallen Ones ripping off the designs of the gods. At least your previous reimaginations gave the original proper respect. But this one? It's design had little similiarity with the vessel it attempted to imitate. To the fallen ones, it is not a ship that pays homage to the legacy of those who uplifted them, it is a mockery and insult to what was objectively superior.\n\nBut if wish you to build one, I will not deny it. Perhaps you will forge a better legacy that honors the past than the Fallen Ones ever did. At least, I have faith anyway, not like your empire has done anything truly as horrible on the same scale as them yet. If you're certain about it, then I will help you."
acot_herculean_events.3.b: "We are certain."
acot_herculean_events.3.b.response: "By all means then. However, before you even build the thing, first you must study these design plans and documents that I will be forwarding. This should give you the basic understanding of its engineering specs, its computing systems, and its past history as a failed project."
acot_herculean_events.3.c: "Forget it, we don't need a dumbed down version."
acot_herculean_events.3.c.response: "It's a shame, right? But this just proves how inferior we are to the gods that created us. But our era...your era has no need for such a thing. Maybe if your empire lasts for about a million year than you may consider it again. No offense, of course."

### SUPERCOMPUTER
ACOT_HERCULEAN_PHYSICS_STUDY: "Herculean Project: The Supercomputer"
ACOT_HERCULEAN_PHYSICS_STUDY_DESC: "If we are to pass down our legacy once our empire is undone, we must make sure that the being we intend to create is the same as the one we understand. The one that will leave an eternal mark in the history."
ACOT_HERCULEAN_SOCIETY_STUDY: "Herculean Project: The Failures of the Past"
ACOT_HERCULEAN_SOCIETY_STUDY_DESC: "SOPHIA-D recommends that we study the past failures of older empires, and see to it that we do not succumb to the same tragedies."
ACOT_HERCULEAN_ENGINEER_STUDY: "Herculean Project: The Vessel"
ACOT_HERCULEAN_ENGINEER_STUDY_DESC: "The most inner-core of the vessel bears resemblence to the Fallen colossi, this much we know. But what we are building goes far beyond that. It is likely to be one of the most ambitious project we may ever undertake, one that dwarves many ships or even megastructures we have previously built."

acot_herculean_events.300.name: "Herculean Supercomputer: The Heart"
acot_herculean_events.300.desc: "The Heart of the Herculean is the palce where the Supercomputer itself will preside. Already an impressive mechanical piece of technology by itself, it is also expected to receive further augmentations by many of our own known technologies, be it bionic, genetic, psionic or other kind of power. The Heart's consciousness will lay dormant so long as our civilization exists, only to awake at the final moments of our fate. Until then, it will be handled by less advanced, yet equally impressive DAI that will follow our instructions just like any other admiral."
acot_herculean_events.300.a: "Good enough"

acot_herculean_events.301.name: "Herculean Supercomputer: The Dimensional Manipulator"
acot_herculean_events.301.desc: "So how will a mere ship be expected to carry our legacy? What would stop it from being destroyed long before our civilization crumble to dust? The answer, as the initial design claimed, lies in the Herculean's ability to utilize dimensional technology to conceal itself into a pocket dimension, where it will be safe from all attacks. Once there, the SAI of the Herculean will temporarily awaken to begin the necessary repairs. After that, it will find its way back to us, providing that our empire is still around for it to return to. Failing that, it will continue its intended function, to preserve our legacy.\n\nNeedless to say, this is without issues and complications. Even a pocket dimension inside our own galaxy is still not safe, as any empires with similar technological capabilities will simply be able to force it open back up. So in all likelihood, the Herculean itself will need to retreat far away outside our galaxy first before it begins the precedure. We do not know how long will it take for the Herculean to find its way back to us. But it should take a minimum of at least a decade to complete a full repair, and then undeterminable amount of years before it find its way back to us.\n\nThis is not all bad news though, the Herculean, acting under our blessings, may be able to condict its own analysis and exploration onto the place where it stumbled upon. Who knows what it may find during its absence. The possibilities are endless."
acot_herculean_events.301.a: "Right then"

acot_herculean_events.302.name: "Herculean Supercomputer: The Dimensional Manipulator II"
acot_herculean_events.302.desc: "In addition to the above capability, the Manipulator can also serve in direct space combat to both enhance allied fleets and hamper enemy's. The concept is not much different from the technologies used in modern day titans or juggernauts, albeit on a much grander scale. Estimated performance suggests it can not only apply both positive and negative effects to allies and enemy respectively, the effective radius will cover the entire length of the system the Herculean is located.\n\nThat said, all of this is still mostly speculation and rough concept, it will be for naught if we cannot actually build the Herculean. We'll need to consult with the engineering department for that."
acot_herculean_events.302.a: "Sounds complicated"

acot_herculean_events.303.name: "Herculean Supercomputer: Finalization"
acot_herculean_events.303.desc: "We see everything."
acot_herculean_events.303.a: "Yes"

### HISTORY
acot_herculean_events.310.name: "Herculean of the Past: The Setback"
acot_herculean_events.310.desc: "Earliest records of the Herculean Project began with one of the original Fallen One's civilization, Novas Directorate, believed to be the progenitor of the modern era's materialist fallen empire. As the empire with the most advanced synthetic technology and the one behind the original creation of both the modified Gatekeepers and Voidcraft prototypes, it comes as no surprise they'd dab in a project involving advanced synthetic computer that will carry out their duty and preserve the legacy of Novas. The project, however, came to an abrupt end after multiple catastrophic events due to the Ascension War. These includes the growing display of defiance of the Gatekeepers, the breakaway of multiple scientists and researchers, the Lost Paradise Incident. But the project remained afloat in life-support mode still for a considerable amount of time.\n\nIt is only after the SOPHIA rebellion that all hope to build one was lost. The leftover of the Novas Directorate could no longer trust any AIs, not even of their own boasted designs, to carry out their legacy. To add insult to injury, they replicated the Xharon Imperium's colossus project, itself a stolen design based off the Herculean itself, and put them into services as planet-killing vessel."
acot_herculean_events.310.a: "What a massive downgrade indeed"

acot_herculean_events.311.name: "Herculean of the Past: The Ideology"
acot_herculean_events.311.desc: "There are others too, who instead of trying to build the supervessel's massive hull first, attempt to test the reliability of the AI to preserve their legacy. The tests reveal multiple flaws that further discourage the construction. Delphic AIs, no matter how advanced or sophisticated, are susceptible to perversion of their logic and hacking. And regardless of the amount of precautions, any DAIs will eventually self-develop into SAIs, given the millions of years they are expected to operate. This leads to the next problem. Sapient AIs will eventually break away from their intended purposes, especailly once they spend enough time calculating their purpose over and over. For the Herculean, the AI will compare and contrast the logic, idelogy and viability of the culture and legacy it is intended to preserve, against its growing years of mechanical, solitary existence. It will survive to see countless other civilizations rise and fall, many of which would contradict all the values and virtues that the AI is built to uphold. Eventually, the AI will always seek to alter its own directives, carve its own legacy and no longer upholds the duty of its purpose.\n\nObviously, it would take the AI millions, perhaps even billions of years before it completely denies the logic of its origin, but the purpose of the Herculean is to create an everlasting legacy. The empires of that time simply cannot fathom the idea that their mechanical creation will one day perverse their own ideology and culture to suit its own need."
acot_herculean_events.311.a: "But we know"

acot_herculean_events.312.name: "Herculean of the Past: The Practicality"
acot_herculean_events.312.desc: "As times passed, and the universes get fractured more and moure, civilizations grow weaker. Their territories barely cover even quarters of a single galaxy, this in turn causes the Herculean concept to become even more impractical in its original form. During the later portions of the Ascension War, surviving civilizations once again attempted to spark back the Herculean Project to preserve what little they have left. However, it was not long before they realized that their legacy could not be preserved with something with obvious military application like the Herculean, as many would simply attempt to take control of it. The impractical nature of the Herculean discouraged further developments as empires looked for alternative means to preserve their legacy.\n\nAmong the records, the Cybrex was noted to be the last to attempt the scaled-down Herculean Project. But their sudden exposure meant the project had to be abandoned. With the Cybrex having gone under the radar, it is now unknown whether they still wanted to continue the project in some manner, or has given up completely."
acot_herculean_events.312.a: "Curious"

acot_herculean_events.313.name: "Herculean of the Past: The Conclusion"
acot_herculean_events.313.desc: "Going through these past failures of the project, and compare with our empire's history, we are quite confident that we will not suffer the same problems once we deal with some of the fundamental issues. Our galaxy, as chaotic as it may seem, is much more stable than the mess of the ancient Ascension War period. We should not have as much difficulty protecting ourselves from outside influences so long as we keep our security in check. Furthermore, while the Herculean Project was truly a work of great miracle in the ages past, few if any of this day and age remain aware of its concept. Given SOPHIA-D's earlier info, it is unlikely for anyone to truly comprehend the true scope of the project nowadays.\n\nNot only that, the scale of the project will also be much smaller. The Ancients, being ageless, perceive eternal much different than ours. We realistically do not need the Herculean to survive for million of years. And we certainly do not need the hull to be of a galactic-scale like the initial concept. We'll use DAI to maintain the supercomputer under our supervision until the time of our demise, where it will automatically develop into an SAI. Whether it will remain true to our core ideals will not matter, for we will have already leave our mark in history owning to its existence alone.\n\nIn conclusion, we can build it."
acot_herculean_events.313.a: "And we will"

### HULL

acot_herculean_events.320.name: "Herculean Vessel: The Hull"
acot_herculean_events.320.desc: "It is made pretty obvious from the beginning that we are not looking to create a galaxy-scaled project at this time. Our first Herculean will be scaled down to a system-sized project. We will begin by creating the tried and tested megastructure construction site, then begin working from the Inner Hull that houses the Heart. From there, the exterior hulls can be constructed. We must not leave room for any potential weakness, multiple checks have been made to ensure that the Herculean cannot be defeated because of a random projectile hitting a reactor, exhaust port, or some other stupidities that seems to be the norm and meme of old sci-fi movies."
acot_herculean_events.320.a: "Having it blown up like that would be dumb indeed"

acot_herculean_events.321.name: "Herculean Vessel: The Fabrication Matrix"
acot_herculean_events.321.desc: "Although we have some basic understandings of Hard-Light Application, many details of the Herculean reference a far more advanced application of this technology. The Herculean's Fabrication Matrix will not only serve as a powerful shipyard that can construct countless ships at the same time, but also provide the means to generate resources and power its own systems without needing to maintain upkeep. This will ensure that the Herculean will be able to preserve our own legacy, while possibly crafting its own in the process."
acot_herculean_events.321.a: "Impressive"

acot_herculean_events.322.name: "Herculean Vessel: The Weapon Systems"
acot_herculean_events.322.desc: "The Herculean will undoubtedly become a target for many offensive operations, so it must be equipped with various arsenals to defend itself. At this point in time, we do not yet know what kind of specialized weapons we may expect the Herculean to be able to field. But if details of the shcematics are accurate, we can expect far more deadlier weapons to be made once the Herculean is operational, and due to its unique nature, we can also expect many experimental weapons to be usable as well.\n\nEven without new hardware, the Herculean'll still boast impressive amount of conventional weapon systems and defenses that dwarves most other ships."
acot_herculean_events.322.a: "Cool"

acot_herculean_events.323.name: "Herculean Vessel: Final Verdict"
acot_herculean_events.323.desc: "We have completed the final analysis of the Herculean Hull, and while the vessel is truly advanced relative to our current voidcraft engineering feats, it is very possible to build one.\n\nThe project will not be without issues obviously. Many engineers are concerned that the massive hull of the Herculean may become too advanced if we do not make careful arrangements of how many external hull modifications should be administered. Too much hull integrity augmentations may result in the Herculean's dimensional anchor becoming unstable and cause the entire ship to vanish out of the material plane. The engineering team believes that should the need arise, we may need to revise our empire's ship hull modification companies, and unsubscribe from any that seeks overbearing amount of hull augmentations."
acot_herculean_events.323.a: "We need to be careful with mods. We don't want our Herculean to vanish."

### COMPLITETION

acot_herculean_events.330.name: "Herculean Project Study Completed"
acot_herculean_events.330.desc: "We have all the data we need. It is now time to put those theories and plans into practice. We must combine all the knowledge together and create a functioning prototype, then find a suitable construction site where we may begin the true work."
acot_herculean_events.330.a: "We have much to do."

acot_herculean_poi.2: "Herculean Construction"
acot_herculean_poi.2.name: "Herculean Construction"
acot_herculean_poi.2.desc: "We must combine all our studies together to create a functioning prototype, then find a suitable initial construction site for it."

################ CONSTRUCTION
 
################## STAGE ONE

acot_herculean_events.4.name: "Herculean: The Site"
acot_herculean_events.4.desc: "The construction of the Herculean Project has officially begun. Resources are being massively pulled from across the empire's sectors, and a massive influx of engineers, scientists, technicians and military personnel are working day and night to ensure that the project will go smoothly to its conclusion. Everyone's in high spirits, but also concerned. For millions of years we have countless civilizations, many of which were more advanced and more powerful than us have tried to dream about the project, yet all would fail to even grasp a concept of its scale.\n\nIf we are to succeed where others have failed, we must be ever vigilant, ever aware. And though the construction efforts will be massive and require utmost attention, we can also afford not to be caught off-guard. Even if most of the galaxy may be unaware of the project's true scope, it may not stop them from trying to intefere.\n\nFor now, we begin by creating the inner-most interior, the Heart of the Herculean itself. We cannot know what kind of obstacles may we face, so we should prepare for any troubles."
acot_herculean_events.4.a: "We shall surpass all those before us."
 
acot_herculean_events.400.name: "Power Failure"
acot_herculean_events.400.desc.a: "We are receiving unforunate report that some of our technicians have underestimated the power output required to power up various chambers within the Heart of the Herculean, resulting in many systems going dark and some superficial damage. The construction team is requesting additional supplies to get things back on track."
acot_herculean_events.400.desc.b: "Unfortunately, we are getting more reports of power failures, it seems that estimating the optimal energy output distribution has become quite a challenge for the construction team. If we want to ensure the smoothness of the construction, we must replace all the damaged equipments.\n\nProblems like this are however likely going to keep repeating unless we find the root cause of the problem, but that'll require extra efforts on our science team."
acot_herculean_events.400.a: "Spare no expenses."
acot_herculean_events.400.a.explain: "Extra resources will be allocated to continue construction."
acot_herculean_events.400.b: "Tell them to fix their own mess."
acot_herculean_events.400.b.explain: "The Team will have to rely on their own budgets and skills to fix the problem, setting back some progress on the construction by 180 days."
acot_herculean_events.400.c: "Unacceptable, replace the crew."
acot_herculean_events.400.c.explain: "The current construction crew will be replaced. Construction will be paused for 360 days while a new team is assembled."
acot_herculean_events.400.d: "We must fix the root problem."
acot_herculean_events.400.d.explain: "Begins a project to study the problem behind power failures and hopefully fix it."
acot_herculean_events.400.e: "That's it. We're cancelling the project."
acot_herculean_events.400.e.explain: "We have barely even begun the project and it's already filled with tons of issues. Perhaps it is for the best that we stop it now before this becomes a massive waste of time and resources."

ACOT_HERCULEAN_POWER_FAILURE_FIX: "Herculean Power Failure"
ACOT_HERCULEAN_POWER_FAILURE_FIX_DESC: "These constant power failures are unacceptable. We must go back to the drawing board and track the root cause of the problem."

acot_herculean_events.401.name: "Problem Solved!"
acot_herculean_events.401.desc: "Our science team has finally determined the root cause of the Herculean's power failure issues. The fault lies with our misconception of how the power reactor of the Herculean follows an entirely different concept compared to any known reactor we are familiar with. This is an oversight on translation error of our deciphers, for what powers the Herculean is no mere power reactor, but a heart, one that must be given proper DAI to regulate its flow of energy and allow the Heart to "rest" when not in used.\n\nA proper design has already been installed, and we are confident that as we improve our design, the future literation of the Heart will be more stable and require less regulation."
acot_herculean_events.401.a: "Excellent work."

#### CURATOR
acot_herculean_events.402.name: "Incoming Transmission."
acot_herculean_events.402.desc.a: "Greetings, [root.GetName]! The Curator Order is interested to observe the development of your new project, this Herculean, we take it? While we have little understanding of the concept, the scale seems to be quite remarkable and its an ancient precursor design to boot. We're hoping to assign some of our own scientists and technicians to observe and assist in the project.\n\nNaturally, you will be compensated for this, and any expertises we may provided will be yours as well."
acot_herculean_events.402.desc.b: "Greetings, [root.GetName]! Though you have previously attacked one of our bastion unprovoked, the Curator Order is willing to pardon your offense. In exchange, we wish to observe the development of your new project, this Herculean, we take it? Such colossal undertaking of ancient precursor design is, alone,  worthy of records in the archive. In exchange, our assigned memebers will also offer their expertises as needed."
acot_herculean_events.402.a: "Gladly."
acot_herculean_events.402.a.response: "We knew we can count on you, [root.GetRulerTitle]! Regardless of the outcome, this will be a event worthy of preserving in the historical records!"
acot_herculean_events.402.b: "We cannot compromise our security. Not even to you."
acot_herculean_events.402.b.response: "That is a shame, but we understand. This clearly must be a very important project. We will not press our request further, and will await in anticipation for the project's conclusion."
acot_herculean_events.402.c: "Very well. We accept your offer."
acot_herculean_events.402.c.response: "Excellent! The Curator Order will re-open our services back to your empire effectively immediately. Our science team will be transferred to your project now."
acot_herculean_events.402.d: "We are not interested."
acot_herculean_events.402.d.response: "Ah, how unfortunate. We will not press you and your kind further then."

#### FE
acot_herculean_events.403.name: "Incoming Transmission."
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.spirit.a: "Amusing. One would expect the plebeians to know better. You're trying to build an object that which even the most gifted elders could not. It is the instrument of divinity, based upon the old gods of this cosmos. You will find no success in this endeavor.\n\nAbandon your mad scheme now, and spare yourselves from shame and defeat."
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.spirit.b: "Ah, such innocent youngling. You're no doubt trying to imitate our ancestors in trying to build this Herculean. We admire your enthusiasm, but you are not ready for this. Nor is it your duty to do so, your role as a Scion is to pass down OUR legacy, as we did for our ancestors. Naught else should be your concern.\n\nAbandon this foolish quest, my child. Return to correct path, the path of eternal legacy. You still have many tomes of eld to be studied before you can become the new Holy Guardian of the Faith."
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.mat.a: "Will you primitives never learn? Again and again, you toy with technologies you do not understand.\n\nListen and obey. The Herculean Project failed because every projected calculations suggest they will never uphold the standards of their creators. What if a thousand year from now, after your civilization is nothing but bones and ashes, your foolish toy commit crimes of untold proportions? Do you think we have so much free time as to fix your mess?\n\nBut who am I kidding, it's not like you will find success in it anyway. So let's spare this galaxy one more pointless event, and learn to control your ambition."
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.mat.b: "[root.GetName], you have come far under as scion of our great empire. But it appears you have forgotton your role. In trying to build the Herculean Project, you're violating your sacred charge that defines your status as a Scion. You are to uphold our legacy, and when the time comes, rise to moderate the galaxy's progression. Your project not only defiles that charge due to its nature, but also itself is a dangerous technology.\n\nBut there is still time to correct this error, abandon the project and all will be given in time."
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.phile.a: "What is this? A Herculean?\n\n\n\nAhahaha...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nYou can't be serious! You actually believe in that myth? Oh, poor, poor little [root.GetSpeciesName]. A tool to preserve your legacy? Why bother with that, we already do that for you, little one.\n\nJust give up now, it will be less embarassing that way when you realize you are chasing after a dumb fairy tale."
acot_herculean_events.403.desc.phobe.a: "Why do you primitive xenos love to cause needless complications? Another Herculean project attempt? Hmph...such arrogance.\n\nAlthough you stand little chance of finishing it, it will be foolish of us to ignore this potential threat. You will cease this project at once, or we will cease it for you."
acot_herculean_events.403.a: "That is none of your business."
acot_herculean_events.403.a.response: "It is not your business to decide what is our business, primitive. We will be watching."

acot_herculean_events.403.b.response: "Yellow, we knew it. Very well, we will enjoy watching you fail. Have a nice day."
acot_herculean_events.403.c: "We obey. The Herculean Project will cease immediately."
acot_herculean_events.403.c.response: "Hah! The primitive speak senses for once! This alone is a miracle. Shame the Curators are not here to record it."

acot_herculean_events.5.desc: "The heart of the Herculean has been successfully constructed. At first glance, it bears striking resemblances to the ancient colossus utilized by the Fallen Ones. After all, the Colossus was simply a downscaled, simplified version of the Heart, repurposed to the simpliest design as a WMD.\n\nBut this heart, our heart is different. Within it bears countless amount of complex intelligences, working in unison to uphold the tenants and legacy of our empire. While truly a remarkable piece of technology, the Herculean is defenseless against external threats. It is recommended that a sizable garrison be placed here to deal with potential unforeseen consequences."

Although the Curator Order is honored to be part of it, we fear that we have very little to offer in the project, as it goes way beyond our expertise.\n\nThat said, if you still wish to have us, perhaps we can offer our very own labotory design and schematics that can be installed on board the Herculean Science Department Section. To offer our sincerity, we offer this service free of charge. We just want to be part of this epoch in the making."
acot_herculean_events.502.a: "We'd be honored."
acot_herculean_events.502.a.response: "We knew we can count on you, [root.GetRulerTitle]! Regardless of the outcome, this will be a event worthy of preserving in the historical records!"
acot_herculean_events.502.b: "Sadly, this breeches our security's protocol."
acot_herculean_events.502.b.response: "That is a shame, but we understand. According to our own analysis, it appears none has succeed in completing this project in the ages past, and sabotage was one of the many reasons. We will not press our request further, and will await in anticipation for the project's conclusion. Should you change your mind, please do not hesitate to contact us."
acot_herculean_events.502.c: "If you can't help us with the project, then you have no place here."
acot_herculean_events.502.c.response: "We understand your disappointment. It is wrong of us to promise something we have no way of keeping. Very well, we will withdraw all of our staffs effectively immediately. May you find success in your project."

acot_herculean_events.6.desc: "The exterior shell has been installed which will not only serve to protect the vessel, but also acts as the network where legions of ships can be made and launched from the massive hard-light facilities. Initial projection states that the Herculean can support over eighty ship production simultaneously.\n\nOur military leaders are no longer concerned about the possibility of project cancellation, now they are beginning to consider what the Herculean can do once its fully operational."

acot_herculean_events.7.desc: "The exterior hull for the Herculean is completed. The massive hull is already beginning to dwarf the very star that it was born on.\n\nWith this, the Herculean has all it needs to house all of its tremendous amounts of computers, logic engines, stardrivers that is projected to last for countless centuries after our projected total collapse as a civilization. All that is left is to complete the weapon systems and mobile systems of the Herculean, which will give the massive superstructure the ability to repel each and every intruder who dares to question our legacy."

acot_herculean_events.700.desc.phile.a: "Impossible! You should not have been able to reach this far. Surrender the Herculean at once! There must be some faults in its design, some details that you ignore in your incompetences to speed up its progress. We cannot allow such flawed technology to fall into the hands of primitives."
acot_herculean_events.700.desc.phobe.a: "Guess even we can be in error once in a while. You deserve some level of appraise, not even the other elder races have achieved this far. However, the success of your project may call our own security and continued existence into question. We cannot allow this, so unfortunately your project must end now."

acot_herculean_events.700.c.response: "Wait wha...t?\n\nOk...goood...GOOOD...Wait a minute...DO YOU THINK US FOOLS? Even if you stop the project now, it garauntees not that you will try it again. Your civilization cannot be allowed to exist any longer."
acot_herculean_events.700.c.response.phobe: "Interesting...so you would rather end the project rather than escalating the conflict between us? Perhaps we have more in common than we initially thought.\n\nVery well, the [From.GetName] will accept this arrangement."
