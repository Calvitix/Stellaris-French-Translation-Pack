 vbp_machine.100.desc:0 "We had detected a machine collective roaming surface of [From.GetName]. Guided by a gestalt artificial intelligence they operate unsupervised, maintaining efficiency and slowing developing self-awareness. \n\nIt is not clear what happened to their creators, as they are nowhere to be seen. Despite visible ruins littering the planet, it is still uncertain whenever they were killed by their rogue creations, died out by other means or left the planet off their own accord, leaving robots behind. \n\nWe should consider building an §YObservation Post§! above their world to study them more closely."
  
 vbp_machine.101.name:0 "Contact Report: Primitive Machines"
 vbp_machine.101.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] is abuzz with news of the remainders of an alien civilization found by our fleets.\n\nThey might not be capable of space flight, but the robots that inhabit [FromFrom.GetName] are highly advanced and numerous. Clearly some alien intelligence was behind their creation."
 vbp_machine.101.desc.phobe:0 "News of the primitive machines exhibiting rudimentary artificial intelligence - the so-called "[From.From.Owner.GetName]" - has not been received well on [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\nA definitive proof of advanced alien life, and a simile of a life in itself, serves as a grim reminder that we are not alone in this dangerous universe."
 vbp_machine.101.desc.phile:0 "The scientific community on [Root.Capital.GetName] is receiving the report on alien robotics with moderate optimism.\n\nThough not organic and possessing only rudimentary artificial intelligence, they are a definitive proof of alien involvement. Although their creators are nowhere to be seen, the [FromFrom.Owner.GetName] serves as a reminder that we are not alone in this universe."
 vbp_machine.101.desc.followup5:0 "The discovery of unsupervised robots has left many wondering what happened to their creators. Alongside previously discovered remnants of alien civilization, their existence invites worrisome theories. Could it be that machines serve as a barrier of a sort, bringing destruction upon their makers as those advance?"
 vbp_machine.101.desc.followup123:0 "Effectively capping off previous discoveries of lower forms of life, the report on the primitive machines, the [From.From.Owner.GetName], encountered by our fleets has reignited interest in the xenological sciences on [Root.Capital.GetName], previously considered a largely theoretical field."
 vbp_machine.101.desc.gesta:0 "We have confirmed the existence of a primitive robotic collective. Not unlike us, they make rapid progress as a collective of networked drones, but they are still far from space flight."

 vbp_machine.211.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over [robot_planet.GetName], tasked with surveying a primitive machine civilization, has reported that the robots have stopped moving. Now they are certain that they will never resume. \n\nFrom intercepted data streams, it appears that earlier today the robots had executed the 9223372036854775807th command cycle and when attempting to start a new one, the whole system crashed. Our outpost has been dismantled, as there's nothing left for us to observe."
 vbp_machine.211.machine:0 "We must study their design flaws."
 vbp_machine.212.name:0 "[robot_planet.GetName]: Self-Destruction"
 vbp_machine.212.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over [robot_planet.GetName] reports that the primitive machine civilization that inhabited the planet has destroyed itself. \n\nThe reasons for the cataclysm are unclear, but from data intercepted it seems that the event was caused by a request submitted by a working drone, asking the central node whether the unit has a soul. After some deliberation, the central node responded by ordering every module on the planet to initiate self-destruction protocols."
 vbp_machine.213.name:0 "[robot_planet.GetName]: Collapse"
 vbp_machine.213.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over [robot_planet.GetName] reports that the primitive machine civilization occupying this planet has experienced catastrophic infrastructure collapse. \n\nIt seems that the artificial intelligence guiding it did not have any actual directives on the long-term maintenance of its infrastructure and did not develop any either. It simply continued routine operations as if nothing was wrong until the lack of maintenance had caused a cascade failure in almost all robotic units."

 vbp_machine.311.desc:0 "As part of its standard operations, [robot_country.GetName] periodically creates semi-autonomous drones to serve as controllers in remote areas. \n\nRecently, however, our observation outpost picked up strange behaviour from one such drone. Apparently, during the process of its creation, the central control node experienced a glitch, resulting in giving the unit much more autonomy than expected. \n\nThe newly created drone has apparently gone rogue, left the collective and is aimlessly wandering the wilderness outside of [robot_country.GetAdj] facilities. \n\nSuch an occasion offers us a unique opportunity to recover and utilize the unit."
