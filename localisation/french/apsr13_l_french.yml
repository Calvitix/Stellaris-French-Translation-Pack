 apsr.13011.desc:0 "A research team from the ship §H[Root.GetName]§! led by §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has reported that they've found a ruined complex of buildings.\nAs a result of scanning, we have discovered an entire city specialized in trade. After a short exploration §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has come to a conclusion that the planet used to be kind of a huge trade outlet incorporating different civilizations from the whole galaxy. At one of the guide terminals we've found some information. The planet was not owned by some civilization, but by a group of the galaxy's major corporations. The reason why it had been abbandoned remains unclear.\nIt is impossible to salvage any useful information or technology from this place, as a a good part of the usable equipment and technology was plundered long ago. We have however discovered a spacial storage container by virtue of our advanced scanner technology. Some dedicated areas destined for negotiation were also found. Although it is but a ruin, it could be restored given appropriate resources investments, and maybe even improved beyond its fallen apex. The benefits that we may receive are unfathomable as of now."
