Interestingly, the elder race has reached out to the $RT_GREAT_KHAN$'s subjects, offering us the chance to serve them instead. Both sides have promised great gifts for those who side with them, and destruction for those who side against them. Alternatively we could declare our complete independence in the chaos."

However, the elder races still sit in isolation, with their technology, we could forge a utopia among the stars. The elder races have refused to share this technology with us, and tragically the horde must war again. You will not be required to take part in the fighting, but those who do will find themselves well rewarded."

I will begin integrating states one at a time, to better ease the logistical burden."

I simply wish to make the galaxy safe for all sentient life. In order to accomplish this however, certain practices can not be tolerated, such as slavery. I do not take this step lightly, I do not wish to become the very tyrant I desire to prevent, but I do it for the greater good. I am also dedicating the resources of the Horde to rebuilding the wreckage left behind by the war. This effort will be organized by a new Federation, the Galactic Horde."
