# I spent a lot of time on this mod out of my own free time, and nobody would like it if someone took their creation

# ask, but I'm always open to help and if you'd like to make new features or add-ons to this mod, send me a message,
# and we'll discuss together about either integrating them into this mod, or creating an add-on to this one.

 # OTHER EARTH
 other_earth.0.name:0 "A Second Sol System"
 other_earth.0.desc:0 "Our ship, the §Y[Root.GetName]§!, has come across a system very similar to the §HSol system§!. The system is almost identical, except much older, featuring the beginnings of a red giant and several previously colonised planets. The largest of the abandoned colonies is a duplicate of §HSol-3§!, which may be worth investigating."
 other_earth.0.a:0 "Most intriguing"

 other_earth_site:0 "A Second Sol System"
 other_earth_relic_world_site_desc:0 "§HSol-3§!, locally known as Earth, has the remains of a civilization from billions of years ago."

 other_earth.1.name:0 "The Ruined Planet"
 other_earth.1.desc:0 "The duplicated §HSol-3§!, locally known as §HEarth§!, appears to have experienced so sort of extinction event billions of years ago. The planet lacks atmosphere, however, most of the infrastructure appears intact. Connecting to local data centre's reveals that this Earth's last communications come from around 200 years in the future. Furthermore, it appears there entire solar system has been time-displaced billions of years from the future! Efforts to discover why or how this happened are now underway."
 other_earth.1.a:0 "An entire solar system transported through time!"

 other_earth.2.name:0 "Other Earth's Data Centres"
 other_earth.2.desc:0 "Our experts have been sifting through the data banks of the alternate Earth. There are conflicting reports about what killed everyone on the planet, some claim it was the §RAnnihilation Wave§!, some claim it was an interdimensional species called the §RBeyonders§!, others claim a machine uprising called the §RUltron§! revolution did the deed, others claim all three. Although it might be useful to note down these possible future events, we're not interested in how life on the planet was ended, as it doesn't explain the massive time displacement that occurred."
 other_earth.2.a:0 "Keep looking!"

 other_earth.3.name:0 "Other Earth's Media"
 other_earth.3.desc:0 "According to several informational pieces of media, most of Earth's most important events happen in the country of "America", specifically in the cities of "New York" and "Washington". Although the continents have drifted since the creation of the media, we used the algorithms to track the movements of the tectonic plates and located the countries new location.\nUnfortunately, our data shows that there are at least 15 places in "America" called "Washington", which will lengthen the search."
 other_earth.3.a:0 "Send expeditions to every city!"

 other_earth.4.name:0 "New York"
 other_earth.4.desc:0 "The search of the 15 Washingtons proved worthless however scans of the city of New York look promising. It appears there was a large battle in the city a long time ago and strange energy pulses have been detected upon entry into the city. The pulses seem to be coming from somewhere in the ruins of the battlefield.\nOur team will begin excavation soon."
 other_earth.4.a:0 "Perhaps we will discover the cause of the anomaly."

 other_earth.5.name:0 "The Time Stone"
 other_earth.5.desc:0 "Amongst the bodies of the fallen, a strange necklace was found to be releasing the energy pulses. The necklace appears to be cracked, revealing a strange green gem inside. Once carefully removed, the gem is revealed to be the §YTime Stone§!, one of the six cosmic infinities, capable of manipulating the flow of time. It is reasonable to assume the Time Stone caused the time displacement of the Sol system but it still unclear why."
 other_earth.5.a:0 "With the Time Stone, our legacy will last for eternity!"
