  START_SCREEN_TREE_DWELLERS:0 "For thousands of years, our people have lived in harmony with nature. We built our houses in the crowns of giant trees and turned lifeless deserts into beautiful gardens. Our beautiful planet [GetHomeWorldName] has never suffered under scientific progress as we we learned how to use its resources carefully.\n\nNow that we have discovered the technology of interstellar flight, every [GetSpeciesName] dreams of turning a desert world into a new Eden."
  START_SCREEN_CHILDREN_OF_DUNES:0 "Once upon a time, the planet [GetHomeWorldName] was a beautiful blooming place, but a terrible disaster destroyed most of this world's water supply and rendered it barely habitable. Many epochs have passed and [GetSpeciesName] know about their past the only from legends. Our civilization managed to survive and adapt. We learned to be content with the little we have. Nomadic tribes criscrossed the Great Dune Sea until the guardians of the ancient ruins rediscovered the secret of interstellar flight. When they announced that the time had come, the tribes united to explore the unknown stars."
  START_SCREEN_SUBTERRANEAN:0 "Every [GetSpeciesName] knows the story of the old days, when our civilization still lived on the surface of [GetHomeWorldName] and did not know scarcity. But our blazing sun burned this world to the ground and a relative few survivors managed to hide underground. For many centuries they dug tunnels, cultivated caves, mined resources, and studied technology, until we learned how to ascend again, seeing what the once blooming home of our ancestors turned into.\n\nNow we must restore the former greatness of our civilization for the glory of our ancestors and the sake of our posterity."
  START_SCREEN_MARINERS:0 "[GetHomeWorldName] has become a vast water world relatively recently. Just a couple of centuries ago, brave sea travelers found the last shreds of land, while the massive polar regions have not yet completely melted.\n\nNow all the floating cities of our civilization have gathered around the Old Harbor, from whence the first spaceship departed, capable of crossing the Great Ocean of the Void and going to the stars, in search of new shores."
  START_SCREEN_POSTGLACIAL:0 "Many thousand years have passed since the survivors of our civilization were forced to hide in caves from a terrible cold. The ancient cities were ice-bound by a prolonged ice age. Now [GetHomeWorldName] has finally thrown off its ice shell and begins to flourish rapidly. This time marks an era of rebirth in the development of our civilization. Technology and industry are developing at an accelerated pace and finally, we are ready to explore space."
  START_SCREEN_SCAVENGERS:0 "We don’t know how we got to [GetHomeWorldName]. There is still a debate about whether the [GetSpeciesNameAdj] race was once servants of the owners of this world, imported from some distant world. Or maybe we were just pets that have evolved as a result of mutations in this radioactive cesspool. However, our researchers have come to the conclusion that our ancestors we definitely not the crazy people who brought their home planet to such a monstrous state and then perished without a trace.\n\nWe learn fast and already about posess almost all of our predecessor's technology. The cosmos is now ours!"
  START_SCREEN_TWILIGHT_DENIZENS:0 "Our civilization has always known only light and darkness, heat and cold. We well know what it means to live on the brink. In this galaxy there is no world that could break our will to live. For thousands of years we have hidden in caves and studied to survive, devouring own kind if necessary.\n\nOur ships are ready to conquer the stars and we are not afraid of whatever may come!"
  START_SCREEN_ARK:0 "Our home planet [GetHomeWorldName] has just been destroyed by a world-ending disaster, too horrible to speak of. A few of our people managed to escape in the Space Ark. We lost our old civilization before our eyes in the fire down there. Now it is up to us to overcome the endless void and find a new planet that will be the haven for the [GetSpeciesNamePlural]. We will restore our civilization, no matter the cost.\n\n§Y It is necessary to deliver the Ark to orbit a habitable planet and survey it in order to begin a quick colonization. The planet must be in an unoccupied system without extraneous ships.§!"
  START_SCREEN_AWAKENED:0 "Civilization of the race [GetSpeciesName] millions of years ago rules the galaxy A terrible threat forced us to take extreme measures and use the ancient technology of conservation. Our majestic city worlds have long been buried under the thickness of the earth and water, and the surface has turned into paradise. Almost all ancient technologies have been lost in such a long time, but we will restore everything. It’s time to start the Great Awakening and restore its legal position in the galaxy."
