 harvest_colony.50.a: "We have to deal with this situation."
 harvest_colony.50.desc: "There have been many reports of unexplainable seismic disturbances on [Root.GetName]. Tremors can be felt across the [Root.GetPlanetMoon], and many of our settlements have suffered damage. While investigating the earthquakes, our scientists discovered a vast network of subterranean caverns.\n\nThe deepest of these caverns are home to some kind of indigenous civilization, and they appear to be tunneling towards the surface! Ground vibrations from our settlements may have triggered this behavior, but we cannot be certain. There is no telling how these aliens will react when they spill out of their tunnels and encounter our colonists!"
 harvest_colony.50.name: "Seismic Disturbances"
 harvest_colony.51.a: "Open a channel."
 harvest_colony.51.desc: "One of our probes burrowed through the ground and intercepted the tunneling aliens on [From.From.GetName]. After the startled alien workers calmed down, the probe was successful in establishing communications with their leaders."
 harvest_colony.52.a: "Compliments to all service branches involved."
 harvest_colony.52.desc: "Our efforts to destroy the subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName] have met with success! We managed to collapse several of their tunnels on top of their workers, and the caverns that housed their cities have been flooded with nerve gas.\n\nCasualty projections are close to 100%, and our security forces are confident they will be able to deal with any surviving stragglers."
 harvest_colony.53.a: "Tell us about yourselves."
 harvest_colony.53.a.response: "Our empire stretches across every pocket of the known world. Only the Great Nothing lies beyond our reach. We have many fine cities, supported by lichen farms and the fish we catch in the large rivers flowing through our tunnels.\n\nThis has been our way for thousands of years. Our diggers heard the faint echoes of your cities through the stone, and we decided to investigate."
 harvest_colony.53.b: "We would like to coexist in peace."
 harvest_colony.53.b.response: "Then so we shall, surfacer! Let us share this world together in the spirit of peace. We would be most interested in trading with your people. I believe we have much to offer one another. We shall return to our cities and make the arrangements."
 harvest_colony.53.c: "Submit or be destroyed."
 harvest_colony.53.c.response: "Ha! It is you who will submit to us! We could have lived side by side in peace, but now our armies will claim the Great Nothing and annex it to our empire. It has always been our destiny to rule all of creation."
 harvest_colony.53.desc: "Is this thing on? Can you see us, surfacers? We understand you hail from the Great Nothing that lies upwards, beyond the stone. It was assumed nothing living could exist there, but evidently this is not so. What are your intentions?"
 harvest_colony.53.name: "Subterranean Aliens"
 harvest_colony.54.a: "To arms!"
 harvest_colony.54.desc: "The subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName] have emerged on the surface! Large armies equipped with primitive yet lethal projectile weapons are spilling from the tunnels, and their vanguard has already begun an assault on our settlements.\n\nOur security forces are responding, but we may need to send reinforcements!"
 harvest_colony.54.name: "Subterranean Invasion!"
 harvest_colony.55.desc: "The earthquakes that were plaguing [From.From.GetName] were caused by the tunneling efforts of a previously unknown subterranean civilization native to the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]! They have breached the surface, and large armies equipped with primitive yet lethal projectile weapons are spilling from the tunnels. Their vanguard has already begun an assault on our settlements. Our security forces are responding, but we may need reinforcements!"
 harvest_colony.56.a: "We need to solve this problem for good."
 harvest_colony.56.desc: "Our forces have managed to drive the subterranean aliens on [From.From.GetName] back into their underground lairs, and they are contained for the moment. This is a temporary solution, however, and it is only a matter of time before they break out onto the surface again.\n\nWe need to strike at them below ground, and our strategists have devised a new attack plan. It has been added to the Situation Log."
 harvest_colony.56.name: "Victory on [From.From.GetName]!"
 harvest_colony.57.desc: "Our forces have been decimated on [From.From.GetName], and the subterranean aliens have taken full control over all of our settlements! They are using one of our own satellites to send a message to us."
 harvest_colony.57.name: "Defeat on [From.From.GetName]!"
 harvest_colony.58.a: "The nerve."
 harvest_colony.58.desc: "Surface creatures! Our glorious armies have bested you in battle, and the spoils of your cities are now ours to do with as we please. We have learned much from your machines, and our weapons are now more powerful than ever.\n\nDo not approach this world again!"
 harvest_colony.59.a: "Let us see what they have to say."
 harvest_colony.59.desc: "The subterranean aliens on [From.From.GetName] have emerged on the surface! Their excursion appears limited to small bands of explorers and traders. They may be willing to co-exist peacefully with our colonists, and perhaps even engage in trade. We have been contacted by one of their representatives."
 harvest_colony.59.name: "Aliens Surface"
 harvest_colony.60.a: "We need to drive them back!"
 harvest_colony.60.desc: "The subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName] have marshaled enough forces in their underground empire to launch another invasion of the surface! Once again their frenzied armies are pouring out of freshly dug tunnels to challenge us."
 harvest_colony.61.a: "They will pay for this!"
 harvest_colony.61.desc: "Grave news from [Root.GetName]! The subterranean aliens we have been fighting there somehow managed to collapse the ground under an entire army that was stationed near one of their tunnel entrances.\n\nThe few soldiers that survived the fall were quickly butchered by the aliens before they could be reached by the rest of our forces."
 harvest_colony.61.name: "Collapse"
 harvest_colony.62.a: "These raids must stop!"
 harvest_colony.62.desc: "The aliens living below our colony on [Root.GetName] have been sending out small raiding parties from their tunnels at night. Their attacks have destroyed one of the colony's major installations, and before our forces could respond the raiders had vanished underground."
 harvest_colony.62.name: "Raiding Parties"
 harvest_colony.63.a: "These murders will not go unanswered."
 harvest_colony.63.desc: "There has been another attack on [Root.GetName]! The subterranean aliens emerged from new tunnels in the middle of one of our major settlements. They overwhelmed the local defenses and butchered our colonists. A few screaming survivors were dragged underground by the aliens when they retreated back into their tunnels."
 harvest_colony.63.name: "Surface Attack"
 harvest_colony.64.a: "Yes. Put them out of their misery."
 harvest_colony.64.b: "No! Bring them to the surface, where they shall serve us."
 harvest_colony.64.desc: "Our forces on [Root.GetName] are still mapping the tunnel network below our harvest_colony. They have come upon a large city belonging to the subterranean aliens that managed to isolate itself from the rest of their underground empire before we flooded it with nerve gas. There are millions of frightened aliens in the city. Should our engineers collapse the cavern to finish the job?"
 harvest_colony.64.name: "Survivor Pocket"
 harvest_colony.65.desc: "We have finished clearing out the nerve gas and the dead alien bodies from the tunnel network on [Root.GetName]. It should now be safe for our colonists to move in. The primitive cities the aliens left behind will be demolished, of course, and replaced with our own advanced architecture."
 harvest_colony.65.name: "Subterranean Expansion"
 harvest_colony.66.desc: "Prospectors have ventured into some of the deeper tunnels that once belonged to the now dead subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName]. They have finally discovered the long-rumored gold mines where it was believed the underground alien empire acquired its large reserve of precious metals!"
 harvest_colony.66.name: "Gold!"
 harvest_colony.67.desc: "Scout units exploring the tunnel network on [Root.GetName] have entered the royal palace in what was once the capital city of the underground alien empire. The corpse of what passed for their emperor is still perched on a massive throne in the main chamber.\n\nAfter using explosive charges to breach the palace treasury, our scouts found it filled with gold and strange alien art. The art will be shipped back to museums on [From.Owner.Capital.GetName], and the sale of the gold should provide a nice boost to our state budget."
 harvest_colony.67.name: "Treasury"
 harvest_colony.68.desc: "[Root.GetName] has been racked by another wave of earthquakes recently. It seems that some of the deeper parts of the underground tunnel network has collapsed without the subterranean aliens to maintain it. Many of our settlements have suffered damage."
 harvest_colony.68.name: "Earthquakes on [Root.GetName]"
 harvest_colony.69.a: "Of course. We will help however we can."
 harvest_colony.69.b: "They'll have to fend for themselves."
 harvest_colony.69.desc: "We have been approached by a delegation from the subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName]. It seems their empire has fallen on hard times recently, and they are facing the threat of a famine. They are pleading with us to provide whatever assistance we can."
 harvest_colony.69.name: "Famine"
 harvest_colony.70.a: "How kind."
 harvest_colony.70.desc: "As a gift to celebrate the friendship between our two civilizations, a caravan from the subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName] have brought a large quantity of gemstones to the surface. Stones such as these are apparently mined by their empire deep underground, as close to the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s core as they dare to venture."
 harvest_colony.70.name: "Gift"
 harvest_colony.71.a: "Let them join our colony if that is their wish."
 harvest_colony.71.b: "We can't afford a political incident. Send them back."
 harvest_colony.71.desc: "A large group of refugees from the underground alien empire on [Root.GetName] recently streamed out of their tunnels onto the surface, chased by a small army. They are apparently part of some sort of religious minority, and claim to be fleeing persecution.\n\nIf we let them join our colonists on the surface, it will no doubt anger the rulers of the empire they fled from. However, if we let the pursuing army take them back underground, they will likely face mass execution."
 harvest_colony.71.name: "Subterranean Refugees"
 harvest_colony.72.desc: "Several xeno anthropologists from [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] have returned to the surface of [Root.GetName] after spending a great deal of time living among the subterranean aliens native to that world. They have learned much about their ancient ways and customs, which will no doubt benefit our society research."
 harvest_colony.72.name: "Xeno Anthropologists"
 harvest_colony.73.a: "Turn the other cheek."
 harvest_colony.73.b: "We must demand an apology!"
 harvest_colony.73.desc: "There has been a wave of earthquakes on [Root.GetName] recently, and buildings in several of our settlements have collapsed with many fatalities as a result. The subterranean alien empire is excavating a new cavern deep underground where they plan to build a new city, and this appears to be the source of the earthquakes."
 harvest_colony.74.a: "Arming savages with modern weapons would be a bad idea."
 harvest_colony.74.b: "They are our friends. Share what we can."
 harvest_colony.74.desc: "After seeing the advanced weapons that our security forces are equipped with, several generals from the subterranean alien empire on [Root.GetName] have come forward requesting that we share some of our military technology.\n\nOur own officers are hesitant to do this, as it would make the aliens more difficult to defeat in battle should it ever come to that. If we refuse the request, however, the aliens are certain to view it as an insult."
 harvest_colony.74.name: "Request for Technology"
 harvest_colony.75.a: "Let's see it."
 harvest_colony.75.desc: "Trade with the subterranean aliens on [Root.GetName] has dried up as of late, with their caravans showing up more and more seldom. Today we received a message from a representative of their military. They don't seem very pleased."
 harvest_colony.75.name: "Message Delivered"
 harvest_colony.76.a: "That's not good."
 harvest_colony.76.desc: "Surfacer. We tried to be good neighbors, but it has become clear that you have no intention of treating us with the respect our glorious civilization deserves.\n\nOur emperor has thus decreed that we must claim this entire world for ourselves, as is our right. We shall drive you back to the stars from whence you came!"
 harvest_colony.76.name: "Message"
 subterranean_invasion: "Hostile armies are attacking our colony on [Root.GetName]!"
 subterranean_invasion_2: "Hostile armies are attacking our colony on [Root.GetName]!"
 subterraneans_displeased: "Relations with the subterranean civilization will be harmed."
