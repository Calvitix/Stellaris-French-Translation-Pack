 smco_important.1.desc:0 "This is a notice to say that in a future update to this mod, it will change in such a way that will render older save files that used this mod incompatible. As a result, I decided to keep this mod mostly as is until 2.8, barring a few bugfixes if bugs are found, so that you can continue to enjoy your current games with it."
 smco_important_understood:0 "OK"
