 techis.1.name:0 "Initial report"
 techis.1.desc:0 "It appears our initial scans were correct. The whole system was obliviated by a large energy surge millennia ago, annihilating every single planet in the system, including its sun, which collapsed into a black hole. Even tho the planet was utterly destroyed and lost its gravity, some of the pieces still hold remains of what appears to be ruins of an ancient civilization."
 techis.1.a:0 "Check them out."

 techis.2.name:0 "Machine Worlds"
 techis.2.desc:0 "Our scientists went to the ruins of the planet's piece with the highest residual energy reading and found out that the planet's surface was once covered with metal and wires, like a giant supercomputer, this planet was able to host and interconnect different data hubs from all across the globe.\nSome of the data nodes are still powered and we might be able to connect our systems and hack into the planet's mainframe."
 techis.2.a:0 "Start the connection."

 techis.3.name:0 "Failing Archives"
 techis.3.desc:0 "Creating an interface with the planet's data stream proved more difficult than we initially thought. Nevertheless, our hackers were able to access the data stored in the ruined archive buildings.\n\n§B'Unlocated redundancies, creating local backup...\nLoading nyblax.log...\nLog: Unidentified creature detected.\nLog: Assigning code beta alien.\nLog: Engaging defensive protocols.\nLog: Beta alien not hostile.\nLog: Commencing social interactions...'§!\n\nThe systems are looping through a file named Nyblax.log and, by the looks of it, the civilization encontered an alien creature they started interacting with. Our hackers wonder if this creature caused the destruction of the system."
 techis.3.a:0 "Keep Reading!"

 techis.4.name:0 "The Nyblax"
 techis.4.desc:0 "The system logs were difcult to read, even though machines are efficient in their data storage, trying to grasp the narrative of events was a challenge our hackers did not anticipate. In their report they confirmed the arrival of the creature they identified as Nyblax.\n\nThe Nyblax and the machines started trading and did so for many years. The creature brought lots of advancements from other civilizations it encountered and, in return, the machines would create what they called The Rune.\nAccording to their logs, they were able to create such a device, unfortunately no details on how they did it were specified.\n\nThey decided to test it before handling it over to the Nyblax. Our team arrived at the conclusion that testing the rune was what caused the whole system to collapse since their last log entry reads as follows:\n\n§B'Log: Rune - Planetary Matrix connection established.\nLog: Initiating Rune debug.§!\n§RSystem Failing\nSaving nyblax.log\nSystem Failure\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data\nCorrupt data'§!"

 narrow_maze.2.name:0 "The Quarri Church"
 narrow_maze.2.desc:0 "Our experts have located the site where the paintings and statues where pointing at, and in so, the source of the signal.\n\nA temple laid at the end of the path.

The tome was open and one of the pages read the following passage:\n\n§B"And by doing so, thy shall summon the Nyblax. For his needs are above ours and our souls shall be eternal."§!"
 narrow_maze.3.a:0 "Continue Reading."

 narrow_maze.4.name:0 "The Dark Ritual"
 narrow_maze.4.desc:0 "The book, which they based their faith on, tells the story of the Nyblax and the Runes. According to legend, the Nyblax came to the Ninsun thousands of years ago promising the Quarri civilization a quick ascension.\n\nThe ritual consisted in mass sacrifice arround the altar with at least a specific amount of people, and by doing so, the Quarri people would ascend into the Aeoloock, a higher plane of existance.\n\nThe book states that once the ritual is complete, the Rune will be created from the soulless bodies and the Nyblax will return to ensure that their ascension was complete."

There was an abandoned lab in its place with tons of research material.\nAfter deciphering the alien language our team started to skim through the research material.

Our best bet is to investigate the White Spire hoping to find another clue to what happened to them, their sun and their civilization."
 jex.3.a:0 "Go to the site!"

 jex.4.name:0 "The White Spire"
 jex.4.desc:0 "After exploring the planet, we where able to locate the White Spire. Just like the lab, this site was long abandoned by the antrophoids.\n\nThere was a digital console that controlled and logged the White Spire's activity. We successfully accessed the logs and found out that the rune worked! They called it §YThe Illusion Rune§! and, acording to the logs, it was used to hide the Sun and turn it into a Black Hole.\n\nThey used the power of the Rune in their labs, cities and planet alike, hiding, enhancing or creating this paradise of a world.\n\nFearing the return of the Nyblax and any hidden agenda, they moved the Rune to the Yellow Spire."

It was nothing but a space bourne entity, one of a kind in the whole galaxy: A Nyblax!§!\n\nThey continues to explain that Vorta started spending a lot of time trying to help the Nyblax in this secret project of theirs until one day, Dniki found out that Vorta and the Nyblax were using Shakzem citizens as sacrifice for their wicked experiments!

Though his intentions were noble, the means where just... sick...\n\nIn the end, Vorta was able to create the first §YRune§! which he called §YThe Arcane Rune§!.\n\nOnce the Rune was complete, the Nyblax joined the fight and tore the city to the ground, destroying and killing every Shakzem living in it.\n\nWhat it did not know is that one Rune was not enought to grant it its wish.\n\nDuring the war, Dniki was able to get hold of the Rune, but it was damaged during the battle of Ekbor. The remnants seem to posses such a device and they appear to be willing to provide us with the Artifact, but, they have a price...\n\nSince the Rune was damaged, it is now non-functional, which means that lots of Shakzem citizens were sacrificed in vain. To fix the rune, another sacrifice is needed.\n\nOnce the sacrifice is complete, the Shakzems give us the §YThe Arcane Rune§!."
