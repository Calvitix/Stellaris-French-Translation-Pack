However, this seemingly gloomy event caused joy and jubilation among the research team. The new, experimental scanner, assembled on the spot from the old one, confirmed their guesses: all this time there was a huge spatial pocket inside the planet, which is almost 10 times larger than the planet itself. It contains an unimaginable amount of matter (which includes minerals). This pocket is shielded in some unknown way; it can only be detected below a certain depth mark in the planet's crust. According to preliminary data, the pocket is stable, but from time to time a "spatial echo" passes through it, which can absorb some objects in the pocket, which is what happened to some team members. Right now scientists are busy developing personal \"echo\" reflectors to prevent further disappearances. Unfortunately, it is not possible to return the lost workers. The source of the echo, judging by the scanner's readings, is at an even greater depth in the same direction."

The ships are now positioned close to each other, and researchers have to cut through their hulls. Notably, the pressure is also dropping significantly; soon we'll have to work in pressurised suits, and in some places it is already necessary to install space-grade airlocks. For the first time, a decrease in gravity was recorded, and as we move deeper, it begins to decrease exponentially. And today, the scanner suddenly showed a spherical cavity dead ahead in which, apparently, there is an absolute vacuum.\nThe echo reflectors were successfully tested and issued to all excavation participants."

 # Этап 7
 apsr_arcrel.207.title:0 "Singularity Core"
 apsr_arcrel.207.desc:0 "We have reached the inner surface of the cavity we found on the scanner. At its boundary, the force of gravity disappears completely; inside it is vacuum, just as we suspected.\nThe equipment placed on the cavity's surface has located the source of the echo and, apparently, the spatial pocket generator in the center of said cavity. This is definitely an artificial, incredibly complex spherical mechanism, which everyone agreed to call «the collector». A dull and pulsating blue glow emanates from it; from time to time it expells whole chunks of matter onto the outside of the cavity. It can be both useless substances and valuable minerals, or even accidentally found ships. It is unknown exactly how, but matter ejected by the collector's mechanism is pressed into the cavity's border; after some time the surface becomes perfectly smooth, and the added matter goes «up» to the surface. Our scientists surmise that this collector works on the principle of «transporting» the matter found in outer space into its own dimensional pocket. The collector was left unattended for many millions of years, during which it gathered and duly stored matter in a spatial pocket. Apparently, now the pocket is overflowing and from time to time the collector sends an «echo» to clear it; this, however, wasn't enough, and eventually an entire planet formed on the pocket's outer side due to the gravitational pull of all the accumulated matter.\nThe lead scientist believes that we can take control of the collector and reconfigure it to receive useful minerals. To do that, they want to transport parts of a small research ship all the way through to the cavity in order to assemble it and approach the collector."

 # Этап 8
 apsr_arcrel.208.title:0 "Breakthrough"
 apsr_arcrel.208.desc:0 "The special assembly of a research ship was a resounding success. All attempts to directly interact with the collector weren't successful, however, unexpectedly, the ship's radar detected an unknown object, rotating quickly around the collector. Although it was not possible to stop it completely, we were able to reduce its orbital speed. Immediately after that, the collector's behavior started to differ - the brightness of the glow changed, as well, apparently, as the frequency of matter emission. Further attempts to interact with the object using various fields and emissions allowed us to alter the collector's behavior more significantly. Apparently the object, the shape of which most closely resembles a cube, is some kind of management console. The science team has quickly figured out its basic functionality. Unfortunately, it turned out to be impossible to make the collector continuously receive the minerals we need; it requires so-called «relaxation» periods, when absolutely random matter is thrown into the pocket. However, we managed to completely turn off the echo. We weren't able to find any possibility for reverse engineering; the spatial pocket's inner workings remain a mystery, and we are unlikely to be able to reproduce it. The collector is currently completely stable, there is no danger of its failure, and mineral obtainment, according to the team, is optimal. The only remaining step is to establish an infrastructure for the minerals transportation to the surface of the planet.\nThe cube, however, is much more interesting. According to the leader of the excavation, the management of the collector might only be a basic part of its capabilities. Our scientists continue to carefully study it and conduct various experiments with it."

Here, look:\n\n«On April 26, at 1:23 capital time (21:23 colonial time), two of the eight power units of the Largesium power plant were destroyed. The incident was explosive in nature; as a result, the reactor was completely destroyed. A huge amount of radioactive and toxic substances were released into the environment at the time of the explosion. Simultanteously, a tectonic activity fluctuation have occured, which produced earthquakes with magnitude ranging around 11.0—12.9 on the Richter scale. This catastrophe created a huge, gaping crevice in the continent, and the worst thing is that it continues to expand, absorbing everything in its path! Our mapping sattelites have managed to estimate and track the rate at which the continetal crack expands, and it seems to be slowing down. The incident is regarded as the largest disaster of this kind in our history, both in terms of infrastructural damage and casualties. More than 500 million citizens died from radiation sickness which struck them in the first hours of the incident. Over 332 million citizens were evacuated from the 900-kilometer zone; however, most of the local population still remains in the affected area. Considerable resources have already been mobilized to mitigate the first consequences. The group of leading seismologists, geologists, and nuclear physics specialists assigned to the Largesium Reactor Incident Committee has strong concerns about the ongoing reaction of the molten Largesium reactor core. According to their convincing theories (and no less convincing research), the core meltdown cannot be stopped, since the active zone, which housed the reaction moderators capable of controlling the enormous power, is now destroyed. Influencing the core from the outside is impossible: several attempts have already been made, with no success so far. We must organise a new expedition to the reactor's core, before it tears the planet in two. It is noteworthy that an experimental boring machine capable of withstanding a squall of radiation fatal to any biological or synthetic organism is already being actively tested. We require your permission to proceed, since the boring machine works on an unstable energy source: dark matter. There is a small risk that the equipment will detonate along with the crew required onboard. Worst case scenario, the detonation of the machine will trigger a chain reaction with the Largesium present on the planet. This can potentially split the entire planet in two, creating a terrifying dystopia and an eternal reminder that some forces will always be beyond our control.»"

The incident is regarded as the largest disaster of this kind in our empire's entire history, both in terms of infrastructural damage and drone casualties. More than 500 million drones were destroyed by the radiation, which struck them in the first hours of the accident. Around 332 million drones were removed from the 900-kilometer zone; however, most of the local worker drone population still remains in the affected area. Considerable resources have already been mobilized to mitigate the first concequences. A group of scientific drones assigned to the Largesium Reactor Incident Committee have strong concerns about the ongoing reaction of the molten Largesium reactor core. Their calculations suggest that the core meltdown cannot be stopped, since the active zone, which housed the reaction moderators capable of controlling the enormous power, is now destroyed. Influencing the core from the outside is impossible: several attempts have already been made, with zero success rate. We must organise a new expedition to the reactor's core, before it tears the planet in two. It is noteworthy that an experimental boring machine capable of withstanding a squall of radiation fatal to any synthetic organism is already being actively tested. We require your permission to proceed, since the boring machine works on an unstable energy source: dark matter. There is a small risk that the equipment will detonate along with the crew required onboard. Worst case scenario, the detonation of the machine will trigger a chain reaction with the Largesium present on the planet. This can potentially split the entire planet in two, creating a terrifying dystopia and an eternal reminder that some forces will always be beyond our control.»"

First officer Maxim Kammerer reports a significant discrepancy between the estimated planet gravity and the actual one. The planet's orbit is devoid of other objects, and it's surface is filled with craters. Second officer Dmitriy Malyanov requested the scan of one of the poles. Request approved, beginning the scan. \n***Day 391*** \nScanning and soil analysis revealed that most of the B-401-3002's surface consists of various meteorites attracted to the formerly small space body for an unknown reason. We have also discovered a pit with an undetermined depth (the ping have not returned), which prompted the second officer Malyanov to propose an expecition. Proposal accepted: the enormous metal deposits that may lie at the bottom will benefit humanity greatly. Expedition crew: second officer Dmitriy Malyanov, maintenance staff volunteers Vladislav and Boris Vecherovskiy. An ultradeep survey cable was chosen as the descend method. The team was equipped with climbing gear, flashlights and recorders in case of signal loss. \n***Day 393*** \nDuring the descent second officer Malyanov reported entire crew experiencing stronger gravity than calculated, which was confirmed by the cable's recorded stress levels. Video feed showed nothing but rough rocky meteorite remains. About halfway through the radio signal was lost, and the end of the descent was relayed by significant reduction of the cable's load. The pit's depth exceeds 10 kilometers. Seven hours later, the load has increased again, and the crew was rapidly extracted. All exoedition members have been unconscious upon return to the surface. Medics diagnosed the severe overexertion and requested the use of partial life support capsules, which was instantly approved.

According to him, gravity became so strong at the end of the descent that it immediately brought them to their knees. They had to continue their journey in that position. Their short-range transceivers did not work, but their goal was visible even during the descent: giant in one of the nearby walls. After crawling to them, it turned out that the enormous passage was only the top of the gates, and they themselves were longer by about a hundred meters. The team managed to descend using their climbing gear and continue onward along the huge corridor. Approximately half an hour later Boris Vecherovskiy signaled that he felt ill and requested to return, but second officer Malyanov, also using signs, insisted on pressing on. Eventually, after about twenty minutes they approached another gate, with a long metallic road surrounded by a void lying just beyond it. Having reached it, the team decided to look around with their flashlights, and noticed that the walls, located several thousand meters away from them, were all made of interlocked plates going upward toward the top, while they were standing inside some sort of sphere. As they approached the center, they also noticed several other gates and other roads coming from them and intersecting. Eventually they crawled their way to the metal semicircle (probably a full circle, but there was no time to circle it around) several times their size, above which a huge layout of a familiar stellar system towered. A tiny body, presumably B-401-3002, as well as the perfect minature replica of a lifeless planet C-401-3007, had a metal rod reaching from the surface to... somewhere. It was not possible to find out where: at this point Boris Vecherovskiy fainted, and Vladislav Vecherovskiy, along with Dmitriy Malyarov, dragged him back. Second officer who woke up later that day confirmed the report and speculated that the recorders could not withstand the gravity and surroundings of the location. After a short briefing with first and second officers I decided to continue the investigation of this phenomenon.

First officer Kammerer noticed the abscence of visible craters on the planet's surface and theorised that this planet will repel objects instead of attracting them. Second officer Malyanov requested the scan from the approximate location of the beam on the model. Request accepted, beginning the scan. \n***Day 486*** \nFirst officer Kammerer's theory has been confirmed: planet C-401-3007 does indeed repel all objects approaching it, and yet sand and rocks on it's surface remain unmoved. While taking samples, it turned out that all material on the surface are bound to their neighbours as if they were magnets. After a long search, second officer Malyanov have located the entrance gate in one of the mountains and requested to go there on his own immediately after. Request denied: first officer shall be accompanied by Dmitriy Vecherovskiy, a man of high stamina, and myself, which will result in a more accurate report. This expedition's equipment will include various weights, an emergency cable and reinforced cameras and communicators. \n***Day 488*** \nInitial cave entry went without a hitch. Inside there was a smooth descent at a right angle to the ground. We began going down. All comunications with the ship were lost almost immediately. Transcievers worked, but with a lot of static. At a depth of about two kilometers the transceivers also gave out, and the EVA suits began feeling noticeably lighter. At a depth of three kilometers weights became barely noticeable, and the end of the cable began floating upward. Some time after reaching 3 km mark we finally saw the end of the descent and another gate. Their design matched that of the B-401-3002 gate perfectly. After letting go of the cable, we floated to the ceiling and saw the same model: the rod-beams emanated from B-401-3002 and C-401-3007 and together entered B-401-3005 — an ordinary dwarf planet.

The drone we sent made it down and continued the transmission. At the bottom there was another gate similar to previous ones, except twice as large. While attempting to get inside, the drone lost connection and was presumed to be deactivated. Second officer Malyanov and Dmitriy Vecherovskiy will join me on an expedition. Equipment will include the standard climbing gear and an ultra-deep survey cable. The standard-issue recorders will be used, as to not damage the more durable and high-quality ones in case of another breakdown. \n***Day 556*** \nDescent went smoothly. All contact with the ship was lost immediately after breaching the gate. For three hours that followed there was nothing but walking along the smooth and plain walls of familiar metal. At the end we were met with another gargantuan gate, beyond which lay not an expected road, but a simple stone floor. The room was cubical, thrice as little as the previous ones. One of the walls had three circular protrusions which housed some form of regulators; all of them were tilted slightly to the left. Adjacent walls and ceiling held drawings of the familiar star system which had B-401-3002, C-401-3007, B-401-3005, S-401-3008 and G-401-301 circled. The last object, which was not marked in any previous models, is a truly enormous barren world, and while it is not the largest recorded planet, it still impressed us with its size. Second officer Malyanov signaled us to try and investigate the regulators, but I insisted on doing that only if we no answers after exploring S-401-3008 and G-401-301. After returning to the ship, Malyanov also began insisting on visiting G-401-301 first, since he «feels that we will find clarity there». After a short briefing with the second officer I decided to trust Malyanov's insight, especially since we are going to visit both celestial bodies regardless. Our next goal is G-401-301. \n***Day 595*** \nFirst officer Kammerer has still not fully recovered, but he is now capable of fulfilling his duties and has thus been reinstated.§!"

According to his theory, B-401-3002 and C-401-3007 are needed solely to move G-401-301 closer to the star and make it habitable. And to make that happen, they only needed to adjust all three regulators on B-401-3005. This theory sounds rather solid, but we need to finish searching for a gate on the current planet first, then visit S-401-3008. And only then, if we get nothing, we can return to B-401-3005 for experiments. Continuing the survey. \n***Day 638*** \nWe have found no traces of the gate.

This large gas giant was surrounded by the usual thick, toxic and charged atmosphere, which makes it impossible to see the surface. After slowly penetrating it, we made out the characterictic gas surface. I ordered to descend. As I suspected, after flying through the gas we ended up in a void. After turning on the additional lighting, we beheld the enormous space statio that we took for an asteroid when we were looking at the model. We immediately noticed something akin to a docking station, but it was so large that even the humanity's biggest ships would not be able to fit there. After approaching it we spotted gigantic gates, through which we advanced into an equally gigantic corridor. The approximate ceiling height was over 3 or 4 kilometers, which is why our ship was able to fly without any problems. Soon we encountered another gate that lead into some room that was even grander in scale. To the left of us there was a computer embedded into a wall; it's monitor and controls were comparable to our ship in size. To the right was some sort of throne which held a truly titanic corpse. All previously found and even theorised «titanic life forms» were bugs compared to this one. THe body was humanoid, yet it was covered in something resembling scales and had multiple tentacles instead of hands. The corpse's head was perfectly spherical and also covered with scales, as well as the double-joint legs. Second officer Malyanov noted that this explains the need for a giant planet with low gravity. Soon after we received a signal. It was not encrypted, but it's encoding is bizzare and requires studying. I hope this message will be able to penetrate the metal and thick atmosphere. \n***Day 826*** \nDespite the encryption technology being new to us, it hid but a simple batch of images. First one displayed the titan from various angles. Second one showed space stations of various sizes with up to ten members of this strange species housed inside. Third image contained titans' bodies with beams going out of stars and into them. Fourth showed the familiar regulators from B-401-3005 in two positions: all on max and all on medium. Next to those depictions were titans and a strange humanoid hundreds of times smaller, respectively. Fifth image was a photograph and showed an unknown ship shooting a giant space station. Sixth one also showed the regulators in an «all medium» position, as well as the picture of G-401-301 with lots of little unknown humanoids on the surface.

As was figured from the file, all three of them should be turned to maximum to make the planet habitable to anyone besides the titans, and we did just that. After returning to the ship and lifting off we saw two beams appearing from the central star of the system and entering B-401-3002 and C-401-3007, which were in turn connected with G-401-301 via the same beams. G-401-301 began to lower in volume before our very eyes. After some time the beams disappeared, and the planet became several times smaller. Our next goal will once more be G-401-301. \n***Day 884*** \nEven from afar it is apparent that the planet rapidly began to come to life. First officer Kammerer believes that life already exists down there, and soon our colonists can claim and populate this truly enormous planet, Titan Home. §! \nIt seems that this unique world and the Ideal Place it houses was made by this expedition. They used a mechanism even more ancient to make life possible on the planet and populated it with colonists from their homeworld. But the question remains: why was the settlement abandoned? It seems that we'll never know… \nAfter extrating everything from the ship's logbook, we managed to locate an anomaly in the center of the planet: some artificial device in form of a cube. Perhaps, it was used in the terraforming experiment described in the log. Also, this anomaly emits a weak signal that was initially mistaken for background radiation of the planet.

This mine is the oldest of all that we have discovered, and on the maps that we found is also the largest. After examining the documents, we realized that there's no need to climb there yet. The mine could collapse from any unnecessary vibration or unnecessary movement, due to the initially ineffective technology of tunneling and obsolescence of the material - the elements supporting the arch can no longer withstand the load.

It seems that this complex is the very first mining complex and the only one that received the so-called Mineral Core.

These coordinates indicate the place of some dumped cargo for the complex, which was supposed to be taken by the Ancients, but for some reason it remained lying under the sea. Researchers who arrived at the site of the object's fall found at the bottom a huge pile of various debris, vastly different from the trinkets and miscelaneous items found in the land ruins.

Incredibly, these capsules were supposed to fall into the complex for experiments, but the ship with the container was shot down. In the capsules were fertilizers of a new generation, which had been unsuitable for use, but in the database there was a recipe for replicating this feat. It is not known why the Ancients reacted so negligently to the delivery of such an important product, but it came to our advantage. According to quick analyzes, these fertilizers will increase the productivity of our plants by about 50%\nRecords were also found that an autonomous energy source installed in a container can be used to gain access to a certain «Last Chance».
