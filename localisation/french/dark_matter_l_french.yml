You must be [root.GetRulerName] of [root.GetName]!\n\nI am Ser Bethesdas Electroniaus IV, also known unofficially as the Legendary Smuggler or something like that, you get the idea. Let's get down to business. You want to understand Dark Matter and how those space grandpas utilize them right?\n\nWell, you have come to the right place! It just so happens that my gang is looking to do a new heist. This will be a good challenge. But nothing comes for free you know.\n\nIf you wish my services you will have to pay me in advance. Especially in case things go loud and we have to use Plan B."
 dark_matter_event.30.desc.b: "And so we meet again. Have you reconsidered? The door's always open. You get me the money, and I'll get you the goods. Ser Bethesdas never fails."
 dark_matter_event.30.a: "How exactly will you do this?"
 dark_matter_event.30.a.explain: "In all of these heists, there's usually the Plan A, or what my crews called the Stealth Phase. We sneak into the vault, dressing in suits and silenced weapons. If we encounter guards, we either kill them or use skills to turn them to our sides. Sabotage cameras, gather evidences, drop bags, take hostages. Every heist is pretty much like that honestly.\n\nIf things go well, we'll be able to obtain your prize, maybe even some extra bonuses. The Fools will not know any better. That is of course if the stealth plan is a success.\n\nNow there's also a chance that the Stealth will fail, which means I will use Plan B. We just go loud, shoot them all with guns, explosions, laser swords, shouts and chainsaws. It's definitely more fun this way, since when this happens, we usually start turning on our loud heist music to 500% volume.\n\nThe downside is that it means less spoils for us, but you will definitely still get your asked prize.\n\nI should warn you now though, our contract only asks that my crew an I deliver you all the datas and samples, not necessilary other...adversarites. If we are tracked, the trails will lead to your empire so you will have to deal with those poor sods later."
 dark_matter_event.30.b: "Let me think about it first."
 dark_matter_event.30.b.explain: "By all means, take your time.\n\nI know this is a lot to take on faith, but rest assured; The Legendary Smuggler never fails, and I never turn on my own customer. I have a reputation to uphold, you know?"
 dark_matter_event.30.c: "Very well, let us begin."
 dark_matter_event.30.c.explain: "Very good, my friend.\n\nThis enite thing should be finished in a month or two. Best prepared your forces in the meantime."
