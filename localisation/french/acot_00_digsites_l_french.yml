The system would have also reactively harvest nearby materials to substitute the missing stockpiles, this can include biological and mechanical materials, which would have put the Excavation Team at great risk. Finally, if too much resources were to be provided, the system would have allocated exceeding resources to power up inactive warships and repair damaged hulls through hard-light reassembling.

This leads up to believe this ship must have been a science vessel of some kind, albiet on a much larger scale than one typically fielded by any we have seen.\n\nEventually, the team reaches a big chamber which appears to be a reactor room. Perhaps with some kind of power source, we may be able to power up the entire vault again?\n\nIf we are to use more advanced reactors, we will need sufficient resources to install them.

The only thing of note in the ship is a small datapad with the following words inscribed\n\n§Y"To any who read this. Congrats! You are the dumbest empire to have ever existed in the entire history of galaxy! I am Captain Trollgun, and this is my gift to you. This ship is scripted to fly to you, the fool who would see a vault of knowledge burnt to ashes just for some trinkets and flashy lights. And why do I know this? Because I too was an idiot like you once. My crew did this exact same move on another similar  vault. I am not a scientist, I know now that these vaults are out of my league. And so did many others who have failed before me. This ship, is made of all the leftover pieces of technologies from each vault, to be passed onto each idiot as a badge of meme. You are one amongst us, brothers. Let your shame be ours, and ours be yours. Carve your empire's name into this ship and let it soar into the next mistake! YEAHHH!"§!\n\nIt would appear that the single green apple in the black box belonged to this Captain Trollgun, who has hidden this ship somewhere. The bottom of the picture is a crude drawing of a guy riding a boat into a star. This seems to depict Captain Trollgun's final fate, unable to accept the fact he has responsible for the destruction of one of the great vaults, has consigned himself to oblivion by steering his escape pod into a star."

It is as if they have been augmented beyond their initial specifications.\n\nAs predicted, the vault's energy readings begin to become unstable, and before we can learn anymore about its history, or what the other smaller section holds, the vault collapses.\n\nThough we are ultimately unable to ascertain the purpose and true history behind this massive vault, these ships will serve us well in battle."

There are designs of ships that of which we have never seen, and prototypes of various technologies that bear striking similarities to that of the Fallen Empire's own ships.\n\nHowever, the vault's energy readings begin to become unstable, and there is not much time. The team downloads what they can of the schematics and evacuate from the crumbling vault. \n\nThough we may never know the true story of this ancient vault or what the larger section holds, these schematics will no doubt be useful to our empire."

Duuring its foundings, countless scientists, engineers and architects from across the galaxy would come in and worked tirelessly to decipher the ancient vessels of the precursors. These precursor ships predate every existing records of any civilizations, their designs extremely arcane and mysterious.
