### Kraggan
acot_pmc_merc.1.name: "Kraggan Blood Pack Mercenaries"
acot_pmc_merc.1.desc: "So you're looking to hire the Blood Packs? Must really want something on the ground very dead then.\n\nWell, if you have the credits then we'll smash any parjack pansies for you. Oh, and whoever is going to pilot our transports better know how to duck...heh..it ain't a proper Kraggan Cargo without some good ol' fashion brawl.\n\n§SMercenary Type:§! Army\n§SMercenary Strength:§! Low"
acot_pmc_merc.1.a: "So what will you bring to the table?"
acot_pmc_merc.1.a.explain: "§YSo what will you bring to the table?§!\n\nTen Battlepacks worthy of Kragans are on the table along with some vehicles and a battlemaster. We are a mean bunch, we don't die easily and we don't back out from a good fight. Do not expect them to go on suicide attacks though, they maybe dumb, but not that dumb.\n\n§HIn addition to the armies themselves, the Kraggan species have Strong and Venerable traits.\n\nA level 5 Kraggan Battlemaster General leads the army.§!"

acot_pmc_merc.1.b.explain: "Now we are talking. Me and the boys will be ready. Drop us on a planet, and we'll make all the parjacks down there be forever sorry they ever mess with you."
acot_pmc_merc.1.getinfo.explain: "The Kraggans are a curious bunch to say the least. Apparently, their entire species have been hit by a peculiar bio-weapon that  suppress their reproductive systems and greatly reduce their fertility. This had the males of the species down to mercenary life, looking for a way to die glorious deaths.\n\nWe don't know exactly who did this to them, as they're already like  this by the time they come into contact. All we can gather is that everytime someone tries to find a cure for their mutation, they hear a very strange musical note, then some random guy always show up to destroy the cure somehow.\n\nTheir equipments...leave much to be desired though. They're using a very primitive set of projectile weapons, something they called Mass-Effect fields. It's certainly more advanced than some early primitive firearms for sure but...compare to anyone in our galaxy? They need some upgrades for sure."

acot_pmc_merc.2.getinfo.explain: "The Freebootas are pretty much just a bunch of pirates. They came from a very curious galaxy, in what we can best describe as a grimdark shitehole that seems to can't get a proper break from one disaster after the next.\n\nHere's the weird part though, these weird greenskins have no clue how their techs work exactly. The mere fact that they can get these ships to fly is a miracle on its own. They seem to have form a weird and primitive psychic connection that seems to allow them to believe that their technolgoies work because they believe them to be so. We believe that this is just a very, very primitive form of technopathy, a type of psionic power that allows one to communicate with machines and technologies as if they are living."
