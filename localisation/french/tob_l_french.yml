 tob_merc.3.1.desc_03: "We offer our lives. What is it you desire of us?"
 tob_merc.3.a: "What's with your stations?"
 tob_merc.3.a.1.response: "Our stations? Oh, you mean the Arks! They are the final vestiges of a long-forgotten time, and have housed all three of the main species in the §GOuter Bulwark§! for countless millenia. We actually don't know how they work, for we've only relatively recently reacquired sapience, but we have have noticed some deterioration in them. They used to be able to move once, but are now bound to this system."
 tob_merc.3.a.2.response: "There isn't much to say. They have been our kind's home for a very long time, housing us until we could achieve sapience. We know not of how they were made nor how they operate, so we cannot hope to recreate them anytime soon, but they do provide everything we need. Other than a way to scratch our itch to serve. However, we have legends of one of them being lost to malicious forces, only for it to be mysteriously replaced..."
 tob_merc.3.a.response: "Ah, our homes are indeed strange. They harbor technology far beyond us, and are designed to prevent any reverse-engineering. They are a relic from a bygone era, gifted to us by our ancestors. We've kept in contact with the other factions of the §GOuter Bulwark§! through special communications devices in each of the stations, but we've only re-achieved space travel recently."
 tob_merc.3.b: "What is the Outer Bulwark?"
 tob_merc.3.b.1.response: "You wish to know about the §GOuter Bulwark§!? Once upon a time, the three species that make up its factions had joined forces, for what purpose originally we do not know, and afterwards cast aside their differences to become a mercenary coalition. After that, we were hired by various clients--even the desperate Swarm or dying Purifiers, occasionally--and slowly grew in power and fame. Our faction, the §HFocal Eye§!, was the group tasked with developing new technologies and protecting worlds with promising life forms. Over time, others grew wary of us, even the '§RAscendents§!' of the time had feared us if only slightly. Then, a great calamity occured across the galaxy. The galaxy fought hard to push back what we refer to as the §BDemon of Below§!, with the §GOuter Bulwark§! on the frontlines, but when we were so close to driving it out we were betrayed and hunted down like dogs. Our ancestors constructed these stations and devolved themselves for protection from the traitors and the calamity, and it seems to have worked."
 tob_merc.3.b.2.response: "Our past is shrouded in darkness that even our brightest scholars cannot illuminate, but we have pieced together what we believe is most important. Originally, the §GOuter Bulwark§! was formed as a protective coalition between the three founder species against several hostile neighbors. We do not know when we turned into mercenaries, but ever since we have upheld that lifestyle when dealing with others. Our faction, the §HInmost Mind§!, was tasked with subduing and protecting spaceborne creatures where we could, even integrating them into our way of life. The only reason some of the less numerous species, like the Ether Drakes, still exist is because we advocated against their extinction. Our power had become awe-inspiring for being mere mercenaries, which caused uproar against us in many nations. When the time came, we were betrayed by the '§RAscendents§!' of the time and forced into hiding. Our ancestors created the stations we live on and devolved themselves in hope that their descendents would survive and eventually continue their work."
 tob_merc.3.b.response: "An excellent question! In the distant past, the three main species that make up each of the factions of the §GOuter Bulwark§! joined together and created a group of legendary mercenaries. We were contracted by various denizens of the galaxy, even the '§RAscendents§!' of the time, to perform various tasks. Our faction, the §HPeripheral Heart§!, was the group responsible for quelling wars and subduing out of control creatures, with our greatest achievement being the near-eradication of the Ether Drakes. Over time, we grew to be one of the great powers in the galaxy despite being only mercenaries, which cast a large amount of ire towards us. One day, a great calamity befell the galaxy and, in the face of victory, we were betrayed and the calamity allowed to regain its strength. Our ancestors constructed these stations and devolved themselves to hide from the chaos, hoping their children would last long enough to reform the §GOuter Bulwark§! and reclaim their lost glory."
