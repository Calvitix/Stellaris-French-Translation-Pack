 pspmod_sless.2.desc:0 " The planet's cities seem to have been designed for citizens of various sizes, which concludes that the alliance is a federation of multiple different sentient species. As there are no signs of destruction or bodies in the cities' remains, our scientists believe that the inhabitants abandoned this planet and moved to another one. Our investigations have revealed depictions of at least 20 different alien species, ranging from mammals to arthropods. Among those species, a reptilian species with four arms stand out with more descriptions, which possibly means they were the leading species of the alliance.\n\n Among our findings was the spaceport of the planet. Further research might reveal more details as to what happened here."

 pspmod_sless.3.desc:0 " The spaceport is completely beaten up, and there are signs that imply ground combat, which could mean the emigration process was not smooth at all. It seems there had been a clash between an armed force and unarmed ones, in which the armed force already fortified the spaceport and its surroundings. Social scientists presume the conflict might have rooted in the alliance's multi-ethnicity, as it is quite common for multi-ethnic empires to experience such conflicts among different species.\n\n According to the data our scientists could gather, the alliance's central government had decided to abandon the planet but had failed to evacuate all of its citizens. The fate of those left behind is not known. However, our team has identified the coordinates of their destination. It might prove useful in finding out the truth about what happened."

 pspmod_sless.6.name:0 "Chapter II"
 pspmod_sless.6.desc:0 " Our scientists found out more about the cultural aspects of the alliance by studying the data gathered from the cities' remains. The civilization had access to extremely advanced biological knowledge and have used the said knowledge to enhance themselves biologically. Downtown areas of the cities have brochures that promote biological enhancements like "Trend of This Month! : Compound Eyes!", which implies that physical reconstruction was extremely common.\n\n In addition, a highly fortified building was discovered in the city ruins. The countless battle makers imply that the defenders had valiantly fought but failed, as can be seen from the destroyed entrances. More about the fate of this civilization could be learned by investigating this area."
 pspmod_sless.6.a:0 "Investigate with caution."
 pspmod_sless.7.name:0 "Chapter III"
 pspmod_sless.7.desc:0 " The building is packed with bodies. Either serious acts of mutiny or a civil war seem to have happened here, as can be drawn from the evidence of combat between armed forces inside the building and the traces at the entrance implying the defenders were slowly forced to retreat inside. Some sorts of headquarters have been found at the very center of the building. All bodies found are seriously damaged. The data stored here might help find out the truth."
 pspmod_sless.7.a:0 "Analysis of data authorized."
 pspmod_sless.8.name:0 "Chapter IV"
 pspmod_sless.8.desc:0 " According to the data, the downfall of this civilization was brought upon by disease, not by violent mass protests or civil war, as initially thought. This contagious disease-which the scientists referred to as the raging epidemic-caused the infected to turn violent in a fit of rage. Logs found in the headquarters show that the central government's desperate efforts to stop the situation from spreading across the alliance had failed. Radical measures such as orbital bombings and military deployments had been taken to no avail on [From.Planet.GetName], which had been the alliance's traffic hub.\n\n Although most of the data found in the headquarters have been rendered useless, the coordinates to another colony have been recovered. While it is uncertain if the coordinates refer to their home planet or not, it will surely help discover more about the alliance if we can get there."

 PSP_sless_alliance_site_3:0 "Central Laboratory of the Alliance"
 PSP_sless_alliance_site_3_desc:0 " Since the defense facilities on  [From.Planet.GetName] are in ruins, our explorers had no trouble landing near the laboratory. The signs of battle show that even such an isolated research facility could not escape from the epidemic."

 pspmod_sless.10.name:0 "Chapter I"
 pspmod_sless.10.desc:0 " Our initial research has revealed that the facilities were a gigantic biological research complex. Parts of the complex appear to have been built only for research on biological weapons and diseases, the latter for the alliance's public sanitation. The stationed soldiers and the scientist tried their best to protect the facilities from the infected, as can be drawn from the remains of hurriedly improvised defenses.\n\n Unfortunately, they were not able to finish the research on the cure before the infected broke through. Their research might prove useful to our technological advancements, but with limited potential due to the massive difference in biological characteristics."
 pspmod_sless.10.a:0 "Prepare to counter biological threats during exploration."
 pspmod_sless.11.name:0 "Chapter II"
 pspmod_sless.11.desc:0 " The frozen bodies of clones and organs inside numerous incubators found inside the research facilities let us fathom what happened here. The alliance conducted research on various technologies related to genetic modifications, which were the driving force for their body-alteration-friendly culture. This particular area seems to be one of the most important ones before the epidemic, as can be seen from the stricter security measures and its size being bigger than the others.\n\n A highly encrypted project has been found at the heart of the complex. From what our scientists have learned from related data, it seems to have been the most important project before the alliance fell."
 pspmod_sless.11.a:0 "Authorize decryption of the data."
 pspmod_sless.12.name:0 "Chapter III"
 pspmod_sless.12.desc:0 " Our research on the project revealed that the project aimed to create genetically perfect ultimate beings, that our scientists want to call it the 'Ultimate Lifeform' project. The project was cleverly connected to the empire's ideology and went on for more than 500 years. The empire carried out experiments on animals, plants, even their own citizens, and other species, collecting genetic specimens to refine and combine them. Their advancement in genetic engineering and biology were mere by-products of the project.\n\n According to the records, the project had been finished ten years before their downfall. But the results are nowhere to be seen on the planet. It seems they scrapped the research results for unknown reasons, perhaps for security."

 pspmod_sless.14.desc:0 " Ten years before the fall, the alliance declared the 'Ultimate Lifeform' project a success and put it to use on their citizens to turn them into perfect beings. The artificially designed genetic sequences spread throughout the empire by a retrovirus, and every single member of the species became 'perfect' in 10 years.\n\n However, their supposedly perfect technology was, in fact, flawed. Their immune system began to attack their brains, thinking they were a foreign matter. Due to the serious damage inflicted on their brains, these ultimate lifeforms turned into raging lunatics with super strengths, and violence and slaughter soon spread all over the empire.\n\n They could not believe their perfect design caused such a catastrophe and desperately searched for the 'real' reason for the epidemic and its cure. In a few years, every last citizen fell victim to the epidemic, and the empire fell."

 ### [Precursor] Egalitarian Fallen Empire, The Coprean Constitution ###

 PSP_coprean_constitution_site_1:0 "Scree"
 PSP_coprean_constitution_site_1_desc:0 " On the surface of this barren planet, a multitude of broken ships lay covered by sand and dust. Most of them are presumed to be the ones that had been shot down in space combat. But surprisingly, some have been analyzed to have come out of the ground.\n\n The remains of the ships that had come out of the ground share a unique pattern of destruction. Half of the hull remains intact without signs of explosion or penetration, but the other half is completely shattered into pebble-sized bits. As our explorers on the field describe, the sturdiest armored ships had been broken in pieces like glass would.\n\n The sight of the relatively intact body of the vessel covered by pebble-sized broken pieces resembles the pebble-filled slope of a rocky mountain. It would need explorers to get up this sooty mountain."

 pspmod_coprean_constitution.1.name:0 "Coprea"
 pspmod_coprean_constitution.1.desc:0 " From the data gathered from our initial exploration, our scientists discovered that most of the ships were staffed with human-type animals with an average height of 2 meters. They were the navy of the Coprean Constitution, a republic that existed 1.6 million years ago.\n\n Although ships from other species were also found, most of the Coprean ships had been destroyed by Coprean weapons, which led our team to think that there was a civil war between the Copreans, and alien civilizations joined in the fight.\n\n According to the operation references found on the alien ships, the Coprean Constitution has been in decline for tens of thousands of years after its golden age. It took isolationism as its diplomatic ideology during the decline, and newer empires came to call it the fallen empire. It probably didn't have the strength to revive itself after the civil war, which sped it up on its way down.\n\n Personal record terminal units are scattered inside the Coprean ships as if they want to be seen. It seems that recording was a deep-rooted obsession for the Copreans, as can be seen from the fact the soon-to-be-dead personnel tried to record what happened amidst the panic and confusion inside the falling ship.\n\n The terminals deleted the recordings after a while without being used, which seem to be a military security measure. However, our team could try to gather and combine the scattered data to explain."

 pspmod_coprean_constitution.2.name:0 "Precursor, Coprea"
 pspmod_coprean_constitution.2.desc:0 " Our team was able to get the terminals to operate and found out some detailed information. At this moment in the Coprean Republic, political turmoil was at its highest with their ruling and opposition parties, namely the 'Goldens' and the 'Philosophers' fighting fiercely. However, the amendment of the constitution-which originally had been the main issue of the conflict-was passed roughly and hastily, and both parties ordered each other to disband. Eventually, the situation escalated into a coup and then into a civil war.\n\n Having been on the losing side for a while, the opposition party broke away from their isolationist ideology. They established an exile government in the confederation of inner galaxy empires and asked for their help. The federation, which had been looking for an opportunity to gain influence in the Coprean Republic, agreed immediately and joined in the fight as the opposition party's ally. However, the ruling party did not stand idly but created a new federation uniting the outer galaxy empires. The civil war was now the world war. The battle site is only but a tiny sample of the war. Although the information gathered is not enough for our scientists to identify the winning side, they have concluded that the Copreans civilization met its demise because of the war.\n\n The story of the Coprean is bigger than our initial anticipation. More studies will be conducted on the Copreans on many more excavation sites, even after the ship's secrets remain to get solved.\n\n Our explorers have discovered a ship pretty deep down under. It seems that it stopped while it was being shot out from the ground."
 pspmod_coprean_constitution.3.name:0 "Submarine"
 pspmod_coprean_constitution.3.desc:0 " The navigation records' security is not operational, which probably is a side effect of the ship's sudden destruction.\n\n The ships were sub-space submarines with an advanced technology that enables the ship to hide in sub-space areas even in the gravisphere had been applied. They were only able to 'submerge' for a short period, but it was quite enough to launch surprise attacks. If they had been used actively, the paradigm of war would certainly have changed.\n\n But the Copreans had long-lost knowledge of designing a submarine, and no one knew how to drive it correctly. As a result, the submarine with wrong navigation warped inside the gravisphere nearby, in other words, in the middle of the planet's crust. Half of the ship's body shattered like pieces of glass, stuck between dimensions. The Copreans barely managed to recover the knowledge on how to build submarines by the end of the war.\n\n A religious writing has been found on the terminal in the captain's quarters, that he wanted his eye plucked and buried on a planet when other people managed to find his body. Along with it was a prayer that congressman Innovo would revive the Coprean glory.\n\n Several civilian cargo ships that were hidden behind other ship remains have been found. It seems the planet originally had been used as a resting place for traders. We were also able to get a set of coordinates for a certain planet. It must be the planet that the captain mentioned earlier. The coordinates were found among the documents inside a cargo ship. Dispatching an archaeological team to the planet is recommended.\n\n Bring back the submarine parts and the valuables from the cargo ships."

It looks like a common, gigantic gas giant, but according to the information gathered, it's a deceiving image created by highly advanced optical technology.\n\n Sending an exploration drone down is not viable, as AA guns will shot it down. Since the planet is distorting signals to disguise itself as a gas giant, our drone will report that the gassy atmospheric storm had destroyed it.\n\n The data didn't provide us with the knowledge on how to turn off the massive holographic image, but it is highly probable that the power switch might be somewhere easy to find."

 pspmod_coprean_constitution.4.name:0 "Vegan World"
 pspmod_coprean_constitution.4.desc:0 " In the gas giant atmosphere, there was a satellite going in the opposite direction of the wind without much resistance. Disassembly of the controller on the satellite unveiled the continental planet, dispelling a gas giant's illusion.\n\n From far away, the planet looks pretty normal, but up close, its atmosphere is unusually thin, and there're no animals at all. Perhaps the Copreans installed a device that only allows survival only for plants and fungi?\n\n However, the planet is extraordinarily fertile, which gives off the notion of it being a farming planet. Some scientists argue that it was a terraformed planet for vegetarians. Their quite a rash explanation suggests that the danger of civil war caused the terraforming process to end prematurely, and the planet's magnetic field was too weak to hold the atmosphere.\n\n An ecosystem can not prosper without animals to balance itself. Nevertheless, our scientific knowledge is too narrow compared to the precursors. We should keep our eyes toward all possibilities."

 pspmod_coprean_constitution.5.desc:0 " Our ground expedition team has come up empty-handed after having been dispatched to gather plant samples. They say the planet has no plants at all.\n\n Our scientists found out the reason why they felt like it's out of place, as soon as they picked off a leaf from a tree after they had landed. All the plants on the planet are mockup. Exotic trees, beautiful autumn colored mountain, flowers swaying with the wind, countless nameless weeds- everything single one is actually a skillfully crafted plastic mockup with preservatory coating.\n\n The rivers and the oceans are made up of acidulous distilled water with no minerals: the soil and the rocks of colored neo-concrete. No life forms of any kind are found here. It's an uninhabitable illusion.\n\n Our close-range scanners have detected over two hundred artificial caverns hidden behind the artificial bush. Could they hold the secrets behind this fake terraforming?"
 pspmod_coprean_constitution.6.name:0 "Underground"
 pspmod_coprean_constitution.6.desc:0 " The caverns were enter-twined with each other in an intentionally complex manner, splitting into tens of thousands of forks. Our initial theories had to be abandoned as more powerful the magnetic field got as deeper it went. Our explorers had to go in on foot because of the severe magnetic interferences and narrow passages. Some of them were unfortunate and got lost.\n\n At the end of the visitor-repelling maze was a vast, unmeasurably huge empty cave. As our team shone flashlights, they could see countless building ruins in the dark. Massive pillars were supporting the cavern's roof, beside the endless ruins of the underground city.\n\n It is unclear if this is the correct description, but the undergrown city is spread out over all the planet's crust. The place where our explorers landed was, in fact, a massive shell built above the planetary city.\n\n A relic world hidden under the guise of a continental world, also hidden under the image of a gas giant.\n\n Did the Copreans want to hide the city from other species? But to do so, hiding the city under the guise of a barren planet would have been way easier.\n\n It will take more time to finish the expedition."
 pspmod_coprean_constitution.7.name:0 "Avus"
 pspmod_coprean_constitution.7.desc:0 " This planet was the home planet of the avian species, the Avus. The Avus observed 21 different primitive civilizations while maintaining the principle of non-involvement. However, as their population kept declining, they decided to enlighten one of the primitive stone-age civilizations and incorporate them into their empire. They were the Copreans that, even in stone-age, got attention from the Avus with their superb intelligence.\n\n At the end of Avus' history, more than 90% of their population was Coprean, as the Avus' population kept declining and the Copreans kept multiplying, both for hundreds of years. Data gathered from a memorial stone describes the last days of the Avus. An alien empire initiated a surprise invasion, and their capital planet was surrounded. The hurriedly constructed Coprean fleet had won them the decisive battle, and a peace treaty was signed. The Avus, however, already went extinct with the fall of their capital.\n\n The Avus' civilization and technology transferred to the Copreans, which led them into the greatest days of their history. Since the Coprean Republic's establishment, their scientific knowledge and level of financial wealth soon exceeded the Avus' by far. The vast fake forest surrounding the ruins is a coffin and an offering of flowers for the Avus, built during the golden age of the Copreans. The maze and the gas giant disguise was protection against undeserving thieves.\n\n The Copreans used the isomer-plastic to keep them maintained after tens of thousands of years, even after losing most of their technologies.\n\n Meanwhile, an interesting phrase of words has been found in the terminal which was sitting before the memorial stone. It said the opposition party eventually agreed upon euthanasia, and the Copreans no longer deserved to cherish this place, along with coordinates pointing to a hideout for the Copreans who might visit in the future."

The builders hollowed out the planet, then terraformed the inside and replaced the gravity with centrifugal force. The habitat was made to be self-sufficient for a small number of dwellers.\n\n The habitat, however, is encroached on by weird-looking planet, fungi, and a creepy layer of creep, which led us to think that the plants went wild after the inhabitants were gone.

The exiles expected patriots to visit the home planet of the Avus even after the fall and left the coordinates to invite them to their little revival movement.\n\n Most of the refugees were members of the opposition party. They were deemed political criminals by the ruling party and left home. As their homeland suffered more and more as time went by, the exiles became sick of the current corrupt republic. They tried to rebuild the Avus empire with congressman Innovo as the new emperor, who had been still working hard to prevent the republic's fall.\n\n The most recent resolution described three epidemics the ruling party had contaminated the republic with and their will to eliminate those. The first of the three was religion, but the second and third item is illegible.\n\n According to our research on the rotten plants, the time of the plants' outburst coincides with the period where no more recordings were made.

They were practically essential in the hideout, where medical facilities were at best mediocre. Since no recordings after the creep's breakout exist, that's about all we could find about the hideout. However, we can draw from what we've seen that the creep's ability to survive and invasive capabilities were unexpectedly strong and eventually caused the hideout's downfall.\n\n Our explorers have identified the location of the Coprean home planet. Our first archaeological findings suggested the existence of such a planet, but since there were so many ways of calling the planet, which we presume to be a part of their culture, our researchers were confused.

Apart from the environment, the buildings themselves are a sophisticated complex of advanced construction technology and luxurious amusement facilities and parks that organic creatures like are everywhere.\n\n However, the planet lost all of its water, atmosphere, and geological energies and became an utterly barren planet, on which no one should be able to cultivate.\n\n It seems that a new city had been built after the civil war devastated the planet, as can be drawn from the remains of destroyed buildings and intact ones being together.

Those green buildings of similar heights and widths were medical centers for senior citizens, called the Tower of Life.\n\n The Copreans trusted their government that they would be taken care of even when they are too old to work. The towers of life were the symbols of Coprean egalitarianism and wealth that the empire could maintain such a high level of the social security system for all of its citizens. During its golden age, the towers meant eternal lives and eternal prosperity.\n\n Thus, they lived eternally. The towers did not allow anyone to die. Although the extremely old had to spend most of their time asleep inside the life support devices, they were able to meet their family and participate in events on special occasions, thanks to the stimulants.\n\n When the election day became the only day they wake, the eternal prosperity ended. The number of people inside the towers exceeded the people on the outside, and the politicians only needed to win the tower residents' votes. Once the prospered empire of the Copreans became a laughing-stock. Luckily, the number of the vote coming from the towers was declining slowly.\n\n However, the decline didn't last long, and the tower votes began to increase. No one had seen the tower residents actually vote, but well, hey, it's secret voting. People outside wanted reformations, but the principle of equality bound them, and the manipulated elections are now a mere subject the politicians bring out to avoid talking about actual problems. Even the few reformist politicians repeated the empty words that these elections are the main problems."

Pro- and anti-amendment demonstrators fiercely clash multiple times, and the religious circles bombarded Innovo with insults that he was trying legalize euthanasia. In support of the ruling party, the press argued that the opposition party controlled the religious groups by taking advantage of the people's admiration for the Avus and the anxiety about the declining economy.\n\n Right before the voting began, Innovo revived a set of laws which had been practically dead for tens of thousand years. Firstly, local governments must supervise religious activities involving critical patients. Secondly, the central government can browse through the supervisors' documents if local governments neglect the management of sanitary facilities. Using those laws, he was able to uncover the linkage between the opposition party and the new religious cult, then ordered the opposition party to disband after a summary trial.

The majority of the citizens who were in support of the constitutional amendment died that day.\n\n According to a civilian history book, the amendment was approved by a tiny difference in votes. But the Tower of Life was no longer the central issue. Congressman Innovo had declared martial law, which was soon followed by the opposition party's terrorist attack on the presidential palace, leading to a civil war. Surviving citizens were either crying out for the nation's glory and the victory for Innovo, or crying out for the judgment to him and the second coming of the apocalypse. The war between the dictator and the fanatics spread throughout the galaxy as the opposition party established an exiled government in the inner galaxy.\n\n Our explorers were able to secure a copy of the resolution at the closed undersea base, where the exiles were occupying. It described the three diseases as religion, euthanasia, and suspicion. The public's suspicion began when the opposition unveiled Innobo's doppelganger. The opposition party claimed to have found the real Innovo locked up in a space prison cell, and the ruling party is, in fact, using a hologram of Innovo to instigate the whole Coprea.\n\n The ruling party, which had only been maintained solely by Innovo's charisma, was split over the incident, and the opposition party gained power with their fleet's decisive victory against the ruling party.

Coprea lacked resources to build a fleet, but the federation was in no better shape due to a war of attrition with the outer galactic federation. They had no choice but to recognize Coprea's independence as they could not deal with the guerrilla warfare the Copreans were putting on.\n\n Both the Coprean Constitution and its home planet were devastated, fallen far down from their golden age. The Towers of Life and the patients were both out of power. Innovo was nowhere; there were only rumors that he had been assassinated at the end of the civil war.\n\n However, Coprea was able to revive itself off of its advanced technology. The home planet's rebuilding proceeded smoothly with resource extraction and the economy back on track, along with the leftovers from the golden era. Unfortunately, at the same time, a new psychological disease has silently taken root in the revived empire.\n\n Copreans saw their home planet thrive in their dreams every night and began to suffer from collective hallucinations. Strangely, they felt stable on skyscrapers but felt extreme stress when they were in places with no buildings. The Copreans used all of their remaining strengths to cover their entire home planet with cities, and no one was there to stop them even when the environmental damage and pollution caused serious damage. The Copreans entirely filled their planet with cities, destroying themselves in a ridiculous manner in the galaxy. Even when the end eventually came, they were still relieved to see their home in such a state.\n\n Even after the Copreans went extinct, the cities have developed on their own and consumed all the planet's resources, turning it completely barren."

The Copreans knew that there were unexplainable strange parts in their history, but when they tried to investigate further, 'the whole society' refused it.\n\n Their fear deep inside of them forced them to record their feelings and wills to identify themselves, obsessively.

Only sentient beings commit foolish acts of self-destruction. Coprean wanted to prove their existence by dying.\n\n Our researchers have decrypted the last mystery in Innovo's diary.
