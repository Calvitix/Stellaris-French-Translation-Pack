############## FOR WHEN FE WARNS PLEBS ABOUT OUTER GATE 
sofe_gateway.401.name: "Incoming Warning Message"

sofe_gateway.401.desc.a.materialistA: "Greetings, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. We are sure by now even your somewhat lacking sensors must have detected that the inner shield that protects the Outer Gates have gone down. Naturally, we are sure you will want to explore them.\n\nUnfortunately, we have sealed those cursed gates for a reason, and while we have been neglecting to guard it, the §EGatekeepers§! have been programmed to attack anything that enters their domain. For your own safeties, do not enter these systems.\n\nThat is all, have a good day." 
sofe_gateway.401.desc.a.materialistB: "Attention, [Root.GetName]!. Even your stupid and primitive sensors must have at least picked up the sudden shift in energy signatures of the §YOuter Gate§!.\n\nYes, the shields are weakening. And we are certain, like tiyankis to the gas giant, you are planning to investigate it.\n\nFirst off, that is not going to happen, the gates are §RNEVER§! to be tampered with. Secondly, even if you try to, the §EGateekepers§! will now attack any idiots who try to encroach their gates. Avoid the gates, do not disappoint us."  

sofe_gateway.401.desc.a.xenophileA: "My child, you must have known by now that the shields that are protecting the §YOuter Gates§! are failing. But you have no need to concern with this sudden development, the §EGatekeepers have been tasked with the defense of these synthetic stars. For your own safeties, you must not interfere with them, for they will attack anyone who approaches them."  
sofe_gateway.401.desc.a.xenophileB: "[Root.GetName], we must warn you that the §YOuter Gate§! shields are never to be touched. Yes, the shields may have been weakened but the §EGatekeepers§! are active. They will show no mercy to those that try to tamper with the gates. Consider this warning a courtesy of our benevolence." 

sofe_gateway.401.desc.a.spiritualistA: "Listen well, my faithful child. The holy shields of the §YOuter Gates§! are weakening. The gates are cursed with ancient evils that must not be set free.\n\nFurthermore, the tainted and soulless §EGatekeepers§!, as predicted, have become haywire and attack all. Such is the frailty of machines. But still, they must not be interfered, for they are still fulfilling the goals of the Faith."  
sofe_gateway.401.desc.a.spiritualistB: "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], you may not agree or acknowledge the true faith. but our sacred codex demands that we issue this warning. The §YOuter Gates§! are not to be tampered with under any circumstances.\n\nSee that you do, or the accursed §EGatekeepers§! will destroy you. There is nothing else to be said."  

sofe_gateway.401.desc.a.xenophobe: "Ah yes, finally the end is near. The shields of the §YOuter Gates§! are failing, thanks to the stupidity of those fools who refused to study their true functions. We should have dismantled those stupid Caretakers, or kill every of those useless curators until they come up with a better solution.\n\nNevertheless, the end is coming and we must prepare for it. Enter the gates at your own peril, [Root.GetName]. We will find much delight in watching the §EGatekeepers§! decimate your pathetic ships.\n\nBegone!" 

sofe_gateway.401.desc.a.machine: "§R<<ALERT! ALERT!>>§! Detecting Anomaly In §Y<<Data Not Available>>§! Designated: §YOuter-Gate§!.\n\n[Root.GetName], please take this under advisement. §YOmega-Class Dimensional Warp Relay§!'s original designated role has been §R<<ERROR!>>§!.

sofe_gateway.401.desc.fallen: "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. We will not mince words. The seals of the §YOuter-Gate§! is weakening.\n\nYou understand what this all means right? I do not know how much of the ancient records in my empire are true but we must be ready.\n\nThe end time is coming. We will abide by the treaties, so we will not take offensive actions. But be very very careful. The storm will come."

sofe_gateway.401.desc.playoe.caretaker: "Great One, the Outer Gates are weakening. But in this simulation, we are still supposed to roleplay as weird machines. Should we keep pretending, or should we rejoin the Light?"
sofe_gateway.401.playoe.a.caretaker: "Keep it up. The mortals must not know~"  
sofe_gateway.401.playoe.b.caretaker: "Just join us. This is getting boring."  


sofe_gateway.401.desc.myself: "Yo, wussup. [root.GetRulerName]. It is I, §H[root.GetRulerName]§!. I come from another Stellaris Session to warn you that this session has reached mid-game, and the stupid §YOuter-Gate§! is going to start causing bugs and glitches and crashes. Turn off the game right now. Go eat some food, or maybe do something else you know?\n\nOh yeah by the way, in my session, I am about to get wiped by the OE so you know..don't get wiped. Hahaha\n\nBYE! And remember, memes. Only Chirumiru ShiRoZ can make a dumb event filled with memes like this. Cioa!"
sofe_gateway.401.myself.a: "Go away. Nobody commands me but...me. Wait a minute..."

sofe_gateway.401.a.bluff: "That is none of your concerns, stop wasting our time, [root.GetName]."

sofe_gateway.401.a2: "We are being serious! You really can't control the Gatekeepers?"  
sofe_gateway.401.a2.bluff: "For the love of..."

sofe_gateway.401.a3: "The §EGatekeepers§! said you are useless."  
sofe_gateway.401.a3.bluff: "This conversation is over!"

sofe_gateway.401.b: "We understand."  
sofe_gateway.401.c: "We go where we please, and we please where we go."

Whatever it is that is on the other side is unreachable.\n\nBased on our analysis, we have identified a total of §Bfour§! locking mechanisms that must be bypassed to disable this shield.\n\nTo begin, we must first find a keystone to initiate the intrusion. Given enough knowledge, we can fabricate one ourselves. We can also attack the fallen ones directly to demand their keystones. Finally we can also hire the legendary smuggler to do the job for us."

sofe_gateway.7.desc: "We are ready to move on to the second seal. We will need a competent scientist to perform this task. Based upon our analysis, the keystone will react once in close proximity to the Outer Gate and turns into a pedestal once it is fully charged. What happens next we do not know, however."

Outlander and her team wished to remove some shackles of our automated units, reasoning that they will not be able to perform their tasks at optimal efficiency with the current protocols.\n\nThat is out of the question, we cannot risk any chances of anomalies within our war machines. Their purpose is to serve us. We tell them where to shoot, they shoot. That is their purpose".\n\n"Should we not at least equip them with equipment that are more suitable for them? They are machines, they should be able to handle some of the more destructive and hazardous gears."\n\n"And what if they rebel? Or worse, if someone hacks them? No, they will use equipment that our people too can use. We cannot afford to be careless with these machines. Remind the Outlander that the Caretakers were products of the Elders, and look what they have now become."§!\n\nIt looks like the materialist precursor had placed some harsh restrictions towards their machine servants.

If the war turns in our favor, we will be able to acquire more territories and then we can make as many preserves as we want. Then perhaps these poor people will be freed to do as they please.

##Recorded Data From Ancient Times - Details the exact records of the Outer Gate Incident.
sofe_gateway.203.desc: "Hello, everyone. It's me, Chirumiru! The Meme, the Myth, the Legend! Now normally this is the part where you're supposed to learn some background lore regarding the past events and who or what the OE are.\n\nYou see, the problem is most of these stuffs have already been retconned to hell and back and revised many times and that it seems super weird for you to be learning it here at this moment instead of during the course of the battle or some other places. This is mostly because this event is very old. You may have noticed that this series of popup dialogues are very similar to the Grey Tempest...because its a carbon-copy of the same code lul.\n\nIn the actual version that I'll do later, this entire window will probably not happen anymore as OE crisis itself will be reworked to utilize more independent event codes that do not borrow so heavily from vanilla events.\n\nIn the meantime, rather than providing you with lores that may confuse new players  due to its inaccuracy, I'll take the liberty to fill them with random talks instead.\n\nAlso also, this TEMP FIX is super...SUPER not tested! I didn't even try to fight the OE in this version myself yet lul. Many of you will die, but this is a sacrifice I am willing to make. Afterall, you guys kept asking for it, it is only fair that I deliver you to your unwinnable, low ground defeat. Hey hey, if you have Gigastructure, try putting the Systemcraft to 1v1 the Arkship and see who wins for me. I will PROBABLY not buff the Arkship if it loses."
sofe_gateway.203.a: "Access Record : Stupid bugs!"
sofe_gateway.203.a.response: "Bugs bugs bugs! They're everywhere. Both in the game, and in my room. I don't know why but a year or two ago, my room had tons of ants...ants everywhere. I couldn't have food lying around for longer than a few minutes before they started coming. But this year, something has changed. The ants are gone! Instead, my room is now filled with cockroaches. Not the big kind, the tiny ones, about twice the size of ants. The ants...are gone. If I have to guess, the roaches just om nom the hell out of them.\n\nEventually I decided enough is enough, no more bugs! I got myself some bugkillers and a bughouse. I planted them around places where I think the buggers will come. I wake up the next day, I see no roaches dead. I thought they somehow managed to outsmart these things, then  I checked the bughouse, it was made open, with clear signs of struggle. I was like "WUT, roaches can't do that, is this like SAITAMA ROACH?" and then suddenly I realize what happened...the lizards ate all the dead/stuck roaches and gets trapped themselves and struggled enough to escape.\n\nAnts...roaches...lizards...what next, mice?\n\nAnyway, enough about real bugs, time for the in-game bugs. OK the one I know atm is that the OE will turn planets into delicious molten rock of fire instead of the gaia worlds atm. This is because I reworked their old bombardment stance to be the ACOT's new Annihilatus Bombardment, and its code seems to take priority over OE's bombardment code. Let's just assume that the OE thinks the galaxy needs less ice villains. I mean how many Ice Villians do we even have in the DC universe alone? Captain Cold...Mr. Frost...Ice Jr. is that his name?...Killer Frost...uhh I am pretty sure there's more. Will this bug be fixed? Not in the TEMP FIX. the TEMP FIX is there to just get the mod working in 2.7 and to see how OP I can pull the OE to be with the updated 64bit code."

In fact, I made a bunch of closed beta submods that...did not really go anywhere because everytime I work on something, I realize "wait a minute, in order for me to continue this, first I need to do that first". I went from making a boss leviathan submod, fallen empire submod and uh wait..there's also the Light Seekers. God that was uhh I forgot the script. Something about a long time ago. And recently, there's going to be an actual Overhaul Mod for ACOT where I simply change things in vanilla I don't like or find to be stupid, and make them work with the new ACOT. It can be quite intrusive to some vanilla files, so the current ACOT will be renamed to something like ACOT LITE, where it doesn't change as much stuff. Hopefully we'll see it get done before stupid Paradox release another major update."
