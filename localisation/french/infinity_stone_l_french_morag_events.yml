# I spent a lot of time on this mod out of my own free time, and nobody would like it if someone took their creation
# and stole it, and tried to claim it as their's. If you want to learn to mod Stellaris, I'm not the best person to
# ask, but I'm always open to help and if you'd like to make new features or add-ons to this mod, send me a message,
# and we'll discuss together about either integrating them into this mod, or creating an add-on to this one.

 morag.0.name:0 "Strange Energy Readings"
 morag.0.desc:0 "The §Y[Root.GetName]§! has detected strange readings coming from the planet §HMorag§! in the §HMR31V§! system. Long-range scans reveal the planet appears to be devastated from a power energy strike. §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! thinks it may be worth investigating."
 morag.0.a:0 "Send a ship at once."

 morag_site:0 "Morag Digsite"
 morag_relic_world_site_desc:0 "Long-range scans reveal the planet appears to be devastated from a power energy strike."

 morag.1.name:0 "Digsite on Morag"
 morag.1.desc:0 "It appears our initial scans were correct, Morag was bombarded by a large energy attack millennia ago, annihilating the entire surface. The planet has begun to recover from the devastation, with small, rat like creatures inhabiting the surface. Our team is working on discovering the epicentre of the attack to determine its origin."
 morag.1.a:0 "Continue the investigation."

 morag.2.name:0 "Morag's Annihilation"
 morag.2.desc:0 "Locating the epicentre proved more difficult than anticipated, due to the magnitude of the attack, however, our scientists eventually located it. The area has the highest residual energy reading on the planet, still lingering after nearly a millennium after its use. Our scientists are baffled that just one blast could have caused this much damage without cracking the planet. A similar weaker energy signature was detected on the other side of the planet, and our team has gone to investigate."
 morag.2.a:0 "Keep up the good work."

 morag.3.name:0 "The Hidden Temple"
 morag.3.desc:0 "At to location of the second energy signature, our team found a temple. The temple is the only surviving structure on the planet and yet alluded our orbital scans. Inside the temple, there are images depicting great battles, but they are mostly faded due to years of neglect. Our team will begin mapping the temple shortly."
 morag.3.a:0 "An interesting find."

 morag.4.name:0 "The Orb"
 morag.4.desc:0 "Mapping the temple proved difficult as the background energy interfered with our technology. Regardless, our team eventually found something worthwhile. A room at the centre of the temple contained a pedestal displaying an orb protected by a forcefield. The forcefield has no detectable power source, nor can any of our conventional tools break through it. Our team is returning to our ship now to create a solution."
 morag.4.a:0 "The Orb must be important."

 morag.5.name:0 "The Power Stone"
 morag.5.desc:0 "Using a device to manipulate the forcefield, our team was able to recover the orb and take it to our ship. Once on the §Y[Root.GetName]§!, our team opened the orb to find something very unexpected. The Power Stone, one of the six cosmic infinities, left on a planet for anyone to find. Our team surmised the Power Stone must have been used to annihilate the planet."
 morag.5.a:0 "With the Power Stone, how can we ever be defeated!"

 morag.82.name:0 "[From.GetName] Destroyed"
 morag.82.desc:0 "A fleet belonging to the §H[From.From.GetName]§! has massacred the population of §H[From.GetName]§!! After a massed and unrelenting orbital bombardment campaign aided by the Pierres d'infinité, §H[From.GetName]§! shattered under the immense force, killing all life on the planet."
 morag.83.desc:0 "Our forces report that they have concluded our brutal orbital bombardment of §H[From.GetName]§!. After orbital bombardment campaign aided by the Power and Space Stone, §H[From.GetName]§! shattered under the immense force, killing all life on the planet."
 bombed_to_shattered_world:0 "§Y[From.GetName] is now a shattered World.§!"
