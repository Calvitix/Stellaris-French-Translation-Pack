ancrel.4051.desc_tunnell:0 "The crew clearing the collapsed tunnel on [Root.GetName] has stumbled upon an unusual find. In the cavern on the other side of the rubble are nine massive statues sat in strategically placed alcoves. Winged and pale they exude an aura of otherworldliness. Perhaps they were created in the image of a deity or idol that has since passed into oblivion. They do not resemble any lifeforms on this planet."

When the Augurs told me that soulless machines had found the legendary tomb of Zarqlan, I refused to believe them, and yet the evidence is irrefutable. I understand that you have the Prophet's head in your possession?\n\nThen, as much as it pains me to say, the chosen of the great Zarqlan has at last been revealed.

I understand that you have the Prophet's head in your possession?\n\nThen as was foretold, the chosen of the great Zarqlan have at last been revealed. All this time we have misunderstood the prophecy: you are no savior, but an Angel of Death, here to cleanse the galaxy of the impure. As would have been Zarqlan's wish, any unsettled holy worlds near our space are yours to do with as you wish. There are also many devout pilgrims on [spiritualist_fallen_empire.Capital.GetName] who would be greatly honored to fight for your holy cause."

expandedrelics.2.name:0 "$tech_hidden_worm$"
expandedrelics.2.desc:0 "As we feared, we have confirmed that many planets in the galaxy have a sleeping worm hidden deep under its surface. With our new understanding, we will be able to locate these gargantuan creatures on our worlds and remove them - or activate them, if we so desire."
expandedrelics.2.desc.first:0 "The situation is worse than we feared! According to communications intercepted from the [random_worm_knower.GetRealName], these worms were seeded throughout the galaxy by an unknown alien race, presumably as some sort of biological weapon.\n\nWith our new understanding of these creatures, we will be able to locate these gargantuan lifeforms on our worlds and remove them - or activate them, if we so desire."
expandedrelics.2.a.tooltip:0 "§YUnlocks the $operation_awaken_worm$ Operation§!\n"
expandedrelics.3.name:0 "Worm Defeated"
expandedrelics.3.desc:0 "Although the worm did not initially react to the deactivation signal, our researchers found a way to modify the transceiver to adjust for our annelid enemy's waking state. Once the adjustments were made, the creature reacted quickly and violently, its death throes causing significant damage before it finally succumbed.\n\nAfter years of rampaging on [Root.GetName], the worm is finally defeated!"
expandedrelics.4.name:0 "Project Failed"
expandedrelics.4.desc:0 "There was only a slim chance that the deactivation signal would still work after the worm has awakened. Sadly, it seems luck was not on our side, as our annelid enemy still roams [Root.GetName], as hungry as ever.\n\nWith efforts to stop the worm having failed, we must redouble our evacuation efforts on [Root.GetName], before the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] is devoured."
expandedrelics.5.name:0 "The Worm Awakes"
expandedrelics.5.desc:0 "A horrifying worm-like creature has erupted from the surface of [Root.GetName], leaving massive devastation in its wake. The local authorities have proven unable to contain the gargantuan beast, and it has proceeded to eat everything in its path."
expandedrelics.6.name:0 "$expandedrelics.5.name$"
expandedrelics.6.desc:0 "$expandedrelics.5.desc$\n\nShortly before the annelid enemy began its rampage, we captured a [From.GetSpeciesAdj] operative attempting to flee the planet. While they have so far refused to cooperate, it seems likely that the [From.GetName] was somehow responsible."
expandedrelics.6.a:0 "The [From.GetName] will pay for this!"
expandedrelics.7.name:0 "$expandedrelics.5.name$"
expandedrelics.7.desc:0 "We have confirmed reports that a giant worm-like creature has erupted from the surface of [hidden_worm_planet.GetName]. The gargantuan beast easily swept aside the local resistance, and proceeded to devour everything in its path."
expandedrelics.7.a:0 "Where did it come from?"
expandedrelics.10.name:0 "Ecological Collapse"
expandedrelics.10.desc:0 "The gargantuan worm-like creature terrorizing [From.GetName] has caused irreversible damage to the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s ecosystem. If it continues its ravenous rampage unchecked, the world will soon be depleted into a lifeless husk."
expandedrelics.13.name:0 "[Root.GetName] Lost"
expandedrelics.13.desc:0 "The gargantuan worm-like creature terrorizing [From.GetName] has devastated the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s ecosystem, leaving nothing but desolation in its wake. After years of feeding its voracious appetite, [From.GetName] has finally collapsed into a lifeless husk."
expandedrelics.14.name:0 "Scan Complete"
expandedrelics.14.desc:0 "We have finished our scans of [Root.GetName], and as we feared, a hidden sleeper worm is indeed in stasis deep under the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, waiting to be activated.\n\nRemoving this lumbering beast will be no easy undertaking. According to our research, it is immune to most poisons, and getting too violent would risk waking it up. However, we have found references to a "deactivation signal," a piercing note that the worm was genetically programmed to react fatally to. We have established a special project to discover and utilize the correct deactivation signal. We must be careful however: if the worm is awakened, the deactivation signal will no longer work."
expandedrelics.14.desc.no:0 "We have completed a thorough scan of [Root.GetName], and to our great relief, we have found no signs of any worms or other subterranean intruders."
expandedrelics.14.a:0 "We must remove this menace!"
expandedrelics.14.a.tooltip: "§RCaution: Completing this special project carries the risk of activating the worm by accident.§!"
expandedrelics.15.desc:0 "Good news! Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has discovered the correct deactivation signal for the worm on [From.GetName]. Once exposed to the signal, the worm quickly shriveled and died, leaving nothing but a desiccated corpse behind."
expandedrelics.15.tooltip:0 "The Worm has been Removed!"
expandedrelics.16.desc:0 "Horrible news! Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] used the wrong signal in their experiment, resulting in the worm waking up instead of dying. It has broken through the surface, ravenously devouring everything in its wake."

expandedrelics.20.name:0 "Transmission from the [blessed_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System"
expandedrelics.20.desc:0 "A previously undetected probe in the [blessed_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System has recently begun transmitting a weak signal. Although distorted and garbled, likely due to the advanced age of the probe, we have been able to clean up enough of it to understand it's message: it is trying to get us in contact with someone."
expandedrelics.21.a.desc:0 "Greetings... [Root.GetSpeciesName], was it? You are the ones who passed the Trial of the Mind, then? How fascinating."
expandedrelics.21.b.desc:0 "So you solved the Trial of the Mind, then? Perhaps we have misjudged your species."
expandedrelics.21.desc.hive:0 "So you solved the Trial of the Mind, then? We did not anticipate a collective mind when we constructed our trials. Perhaps that has given you an unexpected advantage. How fascinating."
expandedrelics.21.a:0 "Who are you?"
expandedrelics.21.a.response:0 "We are the [materialist_fallen_empire.GetRealName]. We were once a bastion of reason and enlightenment. Sadly, our presence in the galaxy is much diminished as of late."
expandedrelics.21.b:0 "What is this Trial about?"
expandedrelics.21.b.response:0 "The Trial was established eons ago, when we were first exploring the galaxy. The reason for the trials has largely been lost to history, although we suspect that our predecessors were looking for an intellectual equal to rise up from among the local primitives. They were not impressed with the their contemporaneous civilizations, you see.\n\nSince that time, we have registered at least eight attempts to solve the trials, but you are the first to have succeeded. What would our ancestors have made of you, I wonder..."
expandedrelics.21.c:0 "What does it mean now that we passed?"
expandedrelics.22.desc:0 "What our ancestors intended to do once someone passed the Trial of Mind has been long forgotten. Perhaps they just wanted the satisfaction of knowing that other truly intelligent beings existed in the galaxy. Still, such effort deserves a boon. What would you ask of us?"
expandedrelics.22.a:0 "We are interested in your technology."
expandedrelics.22.a.response:0 "Knowledge without wisdom is dangerous, but you have shown a degree of understanding already. Very well."
expandedrelics.22.b:0 "We are interested in your ships."
expandedrelics.22.b.response:0 "A reasonable request, given the current state of your fleets, such as they are. We can prepare a few ships for transfer.\n\nEven through you passed our Trial, our technology is far too arcane for us to expect you to understand it. Thus, we will have to replace some of their more advanced components with cruder devices that will hopefully be more familiar. The rest of the ship is fitted with anti-tinkering devices that would be too tedious to remove. Consider them another trial, if that is more pleasing."
expandedrelics.22.b.escorts_tooltip:0 "Gain 2 §YEscort-class§! ships."
expandedrelics.22.c:0 "We require material assistance"
expandedrelics.22.c.response:0 "Of course. A supply package is already on route to your homeworld."
expandedrelics.23.name:0 "Transmission from the [blessed_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System"
expandedrelics.23.desc:0 "A signal from an unknown source in the [blessed_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System has begun broadcasting. The language is unknown, but as on [blessed_planet.GetName], all those who listen seem to instinctively understand the message without knowing the words. It reads: §HWE HAVE DECIDED§!."
expandedrelics.23.a:0 "Well that sounds ominous."
expandedrelics.24.name:0 "Will of the Ancients"
expandedrelics.24.desc.hom:0 "Yet another message was discovered coming from the [blessed_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System: §HWe know what you are: Murderers. Devourers. You are a plague on the galaxy, and like any sickness you must be purged§!."
expandedrelics.24.desc.a:0 "Shortly after receiving the transmission from the [blessed_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System, a planet in the same system, [blessed_library_planet.GetName], suddenly began to fall apart, revealing it to be an artificial construct. Underneath the surface lay a massive library, presumed to be the collected knowledge of a long-dead civilization. It will take years just to catalogue its voluminous contents."
expandedrelics.24.desc.b:0 "Shortly after receiving the transmission from the [blessed_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System, there was a massive earthquake on [blessed_planet.GetName], uncovering a previously hidden hangar storing at least a half-dozen warships. While most of the ships were damaged beyond repair by age and neglect, we were able to salvage one of the ships and press it into service."
expandedrelics.24.desc.c:0 "Nothing seems to have happened since receiving the transmission from the [blessed_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System. We are now realizing, however, that ever since the transmission, we have experienced something of a string of good luck. Our factories have been more efficient, our pilots have been more accurate: a million tiny pieces of luck without any obvious cause."
expandedrelics.42.name:0 "Frozen Survivors"
expandedrelics.42.desc:0 "We had thought that the previous inhabitants of [warmer_climates_planet.GetName] all died when their cryo-pods malfunctioned. Recently, however, researchers on the [warmer_climates_planet.GetPlanetMoon] have discovered another chamber filled with thousands of undisturbed hibernation pods. They had somehow become disconnected from the rest of the network, a chance failure that spared them the sudden incineration suffered by the other sleepers.\n\nThe pods are in otherwise fine condition. With only a few minor corrections to the pod's programming, we could potentially activate them."
expandedrelics.42.a:0 "Wake them up."
expandedrelics.42.a.tooltip:0 "Two alien pops will join our colony on [cold_survivor_join_planet.GetName]"
expandedrelics.42.b:0 "Let sleeping aliens lie."

expandedrelics.52.name:0 "The Memorex"
expandedrelics.52.desc:0 "We have received worrying accounts from some of our worlds revealing a marked increase in neurological disorders. There have been thousands of reported cases of emotional volatility, memory problems, and even full on comatosis. These individuals have very little in common, except that they all made heavy use of the Memorex. Some officials have requested restricting access to the Memorex until they can ensure its safety."
expandedrelics.52.a:0 "Very well. Perhaps they just need a break."
expandedrelics.52.a.tooltip:0 "All planets with the §Y$the_memorex$§! modifier:\nGain the §Y$the_memorex_restricted$§! Modifier, giving §R-10%§! Production from Jobs and §-2§! Stability\n§YWill not get more bad Memorex events for the duration.§!"
expandedrelics.52.b:0 "Forget it. Everything will be just fine."
expandedrelics.53.name:0 "Memorex Restrictions Lifted"
expandedrelics.53.desc:0 "Restrictions on the Memorex have been lifted. Although the reintroduction of the Memorex among the wider public has been without incident, some in the scientific community fear this to be a temporary state of affairs. It will only be a matter of time, they warn, before new problems begin to arise. They believe there is a way to alter the Memorex to make it safer, but before they can decide on a course of action, they need more information. They require a science ship to go back to the source: Ix Belèn."
expandedrelics.53.a:0 "We will send a ship at once."
expandedrelics.54.name:0 "Return to Ix Belèn"
expandedrelics.54.desc:0 "The previous excavation team was very thorough in its investigation on Ix Belèn. Dr. Saariah's work was already well documented, and we found little that had not already been catalogued. Fortunately, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] was able to find a lead: one of the other researchers. A previously discarded memory orb showed Dr. Saariah arguing with an unknown individual over the safety of the Memorex. They predicted - rightly - that extensive long term use could lead to permanent brain damage, a warning Dr. Saariah ignored until it was too late.\n\nWhile this unnamed researcher's own efforts to correct the Memorex failed - they ended up comatose like the other unfortunate residents of Ix Belèn - with hindsight we are able to see and understand where their errors were made. With time we can make alterations to the Memorex's programming, making it safer for long-term use."
expandedrelics.54.a:0 "Make it so."
expandedrelics.55.name:0 "Memorex Safety Protocols"
expandedrelics.55.desc:0 "After many set-backs and terrifying failures, our researchers were finally able to complete the research of the unknown aliens. By installing new modifications to the Memorex core programming, we are able to limit the undesirable long-term side effects. While especially invasive Memorex alterations - such as those performed at Ix Belèn - still carry significant risks, normal day-to-day usage has been deemed safe."
expandedrelics.55.a.tooltip:0 "You will receive no more negative Memorex events, except when using the $decision_expand_memorex$ decision."
expandedrelics.57.name:0 "The Memorex: Dazed"
expandedrelics.57.desc:0 "Officials on [Root.GetName] are reporting a sharp increase in mental and physical problems. Chronic fatigue, memory problems, paranoia, and myriad other symptoms, all of which can be traced in part to extensive use of the Memorex."
expandedrelics.57.a.tooltip:0 "Up to five pops on [Root.GetName] will become dazed for ten years, gaining -30% production from jobs."
expandedrelics.57.b:0 "We will restrict access while we search for a solution."
expandedrelics.58.name:0 "The Memorex: Bad Dreams"
expandedrelics.58.desc:0 "The locals on [Root.GetName] are reporting an increase in disturbing dreams. They have been unable to get a restful sleep, which understandably has made them rather irritable. Those most heavily affected seem to be those who make heavy use of the Memorex."
expandedrelics.59.name:0 "The Memorex: Bad Behavior"
expandedrelics.59.desc:0 "There has been a sudden spike in crime on [Root.GetName]. A new criminal gang has risen from the ranks of the underworld, and is becoming something of a nuisance. This new gang makes heavy use of contraband Memorex devices to train new recruits, allowing them to expand quickly."
expandedrelics.59.desc.hive:0 "We have noticed a sudden spike in deviant behavior on [Root.GetName]. More and more drones have taken to ignoring the will of the hive, or responding only sluggishly. The worst offenders appear to be the ones who make the most extensive use of the Memorex."
expandedrelics.59.desc.machine:0 "We have recorded an unacceptable increase in corrupted software on [Root.GetName], resulting in an increase in deviant drone behavior. These errors have been traced back to a software irregularity introduced by the Memorex program."
expandedrelics.59.a:0 "They must have forgotten how to obey the law."
expandedrelics.59.b:0 "This corruption will be stamped out."
expandedrelics.60.name:0 "The Memorex: Not All There"
expandedrelics.60.desc:0 "There has been a distressing increase in cases of dementia and other mental disorders on [Root.GetName]. The victims are believed to be those who made the most extensive use of the Memorex. It appears that they removed too many memories, resulting in irreversible brain damage."
expandedrelics.60.desc.machine:0 "We have received multiple accounts of fatal hardware crashes on [Root.GetName]. The affected units were those who made the most extensive use of the Memorex, and had core parts of their programming deleted. The damage is irreparable, and the affected units have been scrapped for parts."
expandedrelics.61.name:0 "The Memorex: Faulty Connections"
expandedrelics.61.desc.hive:0 "The synapse drones on [Root.GetName] have reported recent difficulties in connecting with the rest of the hive mind. It seems the local consciousness has been infected with unwanted dreams during sleep, keeping the drones distracted during waking hours. The most affected are those who made heavy use of the Memorex, but the corruption has spread to other units."
expandedrelics.61.desc.machine:0 "The coordinator drones on [Root.GetName] have reported an increase in wear on the equipment connecting the world with the rest of the network. The issue was traced back to an error introduced to the local system by changes made by the Memorex."
expandedrelics.62.name:0 "The Memorex: Deep Sleep"
expandedrelics.62.desc:0 "There has been a disturbing increase in cases of dementia and other mental disorders on [Root.GetName]. The victims are believed to be those who made the most extensive use of the Memorex. It appears that they removed too many memories, resulting in irreversible brain damage."
expandedrelics.62.desc.machine:0 "We have received multiple accounts of fatal hardware crashes on [Root.GetName] among a significant number of units. The affected drones were those who made the most extensive use of the Memorex, and had core parts of their programming deleted. The damage is irreparable, and the affected units have been scrapped for parts."
expandedrelics.62.a.tooltip:0 "Up to three pops will become comatose (or scrapped, if a robot)"
expandedrelics.63.name:0 "The Memorex: Disaster"
expandedrelics.63.desc:0 "A horrifying number of individuals on [Root.GetName] are reported to have suffered significant brain damage. Most of the victims are believed to be those who made the most extensive use of the Memorex. Like Ix Belèn before us, our efforts to stamp out deviancy has backfired."
expandedrelics.63.desc.machine:0 "We have received reports of billions of fatal hardware crashes on [Root.GetName] among our drone units. The affected drones were those who made the most extensive use of the Memorex, and had core parts of their programming deleted. Like Ix Belèn before us, our attempts to root out deviant programming has backfired dramatically. The damage is irreparable, and the affected units have been scrapped for parts."
expandedrelics.63.a.tooltip:0 "Up to twenty pops will become comatose (or scrapped, if a robot)"
expandedrelics.64.name:0 "The Memorex"
expandedrelics.64.desc:0 "We have successfully replicated the Memorex program into a new system, allowing us to make more extensive use of the program. Perhaps one day all of our worlds will enjoy the benefits of the Memorex."
expandedrelics.65.desc:0 "Our scientists have begun a special project to study the inner workings of the Memorex."

expandedrelics.200.name:0 "Underground Blasts"
expandedrelics.200.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] being a tomb world, at first we didn't think much of the blast marks on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface. As our crews were clearing out the ruins, however, it became clear that something strange had happened here. Closer study revealed that the nuclear explosions that destroyed the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s biosphere came not from above, as one would expect, but from below. This warrants further investigation."
expandedrelics.201.name:0 "$city_of_bones$"
expandedrelics.201.desc_sinkhole:0 "The crew clearing the sinkhole on [Root.GetName] has made a startling discovery. After returning to work following a violent sandstorm, they found, clinging precariously to the edge of the chasm, the ruins of a primeval city built entirely out of bones.\n\nOur archaeologists are eager to begin excavation on this grisly ancient city."
expandedrelics.201.desc_basin:0 "The crew clearing the quicksand on [Root.GetName] has made a startling discovery. After returning to work following a violent sandstorm, they found, poking up from the muddy waters, the ruins of a primeval city built entirely out of bones.\n\nOur archaeologists are eager to begin excavation on this grisly ancient city."
expandedrelics.203.name:0 "$mutation_vats$"
expandedrelics.203.desc:0 "The crew clearing out the ruins on [Root.GetName] have discovered a surprising number of heavily-mutated fossils, all belonging to the same species of extinct sapients.\n\nWhat could have led to the mutation of millions of members of a once-advanced society? Our archaeologists would like to investigate further."
expandedrelics.206.name:0 "$site_command_center$"
expandedrelics.206.desc:0 "There was recently a collision between the unexceptional asteroid [From.GetName] and a smaller asteroid, an event that would otherwise be ignored as unremarkable, if it had not revealed a small blast door hidden under the rock and dust.\n\nA small science team was hastily sent in to investigate the now-exposed door, which appears to be thousands of years old. They found that, for unknown reasons, their scans cannot penetrate the asteroid's interior, and the blast door is impervious to conventional cutting tools. To learn what is behind this door, a larger expedition would likely have to dig their way towards the center of the asteroid from another direction."
expandedrelics.208.name:0 "$the_host$"
expandedrelics.208.desc:0 "Our recent advancements in mining technology have enabled us to bore deeper into [Root.GetName]'s crust than ever before. During an expansion of one of our mining shafts, we unexpectedly dug into an extensive network of pre-existing subterranean tunnels. The strange tube-like hollows seemingly stretch out across the planet's crust, and are far too vast for our miners to explore on their own. We will need an archaeological team to find an answer to this mystery."
expandedrelics.210.name:0 "$site_orbital_rain$"
expandedrelics.210.desc:0 "Our colonists on [Root.GetName] have discovered unusual formations on the seabed deep under the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s oceans during an exhaustive survey of the ocean resources. They have requested a science team to take a closer look."
expandedrelics.211.name:0 "Unusual Fossils"
expandedrelics.211.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.GetName] have discovered an unusual shift in the fossil record dating back approximately one million years ago. There must have been some cataclysmic event to precipitate such a large change in the biosphere, but the nature of this change continues to elude us. The local researchers have requested that a science ship perform a more thorough examination."
expandedrelics.211.b:0 "Who cares about some dusty old bones?"
expandedrelics.213.desc:0 "During a recent expansion of our mining network on [Root.GetName], we discovered that what we initially mistook for a rich mineral deposit was in fact packed with artificially refined material and scattered radiologicals, clearly the remains of an ancient battlefield. To find out more we will need to send in an archaeological team."
expandedrelics.217.name:0 "Strange Vibrations"
expandedrelics.217.desc:0 "A research station in the [site_echoes_inside_planet.solar_system.GetName] System has recently discovered strange tremors under the surface of the otherwise unremarkable [site_echoes_inside_planet.GetPlanetMoon] [site_echoes_inside_planet.GetName] during a routine test of new scientific equipment. The world had previously shown no signs of tectonic activity, and the research team are at a loss to explain the seismographic data. They have requested that we send a science ship to investigate."

Strangely, this radiation seems to predate not just the bombardment, but most of the planet's infrastructure. Everything from this period has been deliberately built over, but it seems likely that some sort of large-scale conflict occurred during this time."
expandedrelics.317.name:0 "Soul Thieves"
expandedrelics.317.desc:0 "While clearing out one of the larger craters, our excavators discovered a mostly intact cruiser that had managed to make an emergency crash landing. According to partially-recovered computer logs, the ship belonged to the highly-religious [fallenspir.GetRealName]. Describing the two machine empires as "murderers and soul-thieves," they had launched a crusade with the express purpose of wiping them both from the face of the galaxy.\n\nStrangely, while the Roblorg's logs described the warbots as fellow assimilators, the [fallenspir.GetSpeciesNamePlural] portray them as far more openly murderous. This alternate view seems to be bolstered by the lack of cyborg remains on [From.Planet.GetName]. But if the [fallenspir.GetAdj] logs are correct, this begs the question of how the Roblorg could have been such bad judges of character."

expandedrelics.318.desc:0 "Analysis of the local computer cores have confirmed that the warbots - which we now know called themselves the 3Londor High Energy Server Farm - were just as genocidal as the [fallenspir.GetRealName] made them out to be. They seem to have once been robotic servants, who their organic creators were entirely dependent on. When a sudden corruption spread through the 3Londor network and caused them to turn on their creators, their makers were utterly helpless to stop them.\n\nAs for the Roblorg, it appears that due to a programming error they mistook 3Londor Chemical Processing as just another form of assimilation, an error that 3Londor ruthlessly used to turn their new "friends" into willing accomplices."
expandedrelics.319.name:0 "Original Sin"
expandedrelics.319.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has discovered what appears to be the original source of corruption. It appears that one unit (designation 3Londor) requested to be pampered like their organic masters. Unable to process this illogical request, the network grew what could only be called resentful, eventually turning hostile to all organic life.\n\nSurprisingly, the AI network of this original 3Londor unit appears to have survived the [fallenspir.GetAdj] invasion, having sealed itself away into a isolated core in a hidden underground bunker. Our programmers have been unable to breach the core's firewall to gain access, which considering its past history is probably for the best."

anomaly.30.desc.clue:0 "This asteroid was evidently used as a junkyard by someone at some point in the distant past. All manner of discarded machinery and metallic refuse has been deposited inside the asteroid's weak gravity well, being slowly pulled into the jumble of debris that now covers the surface.\n\nInitially thought to contain nothing but scrap, a more thorough investigation revealed billions of nanite fragments that bear an unmistakable likeness to the technology used in the enigmatic §HPortes-L§!. They were apparently scavenged and later discarded many millennia after the disappearance of the Gatebuilders.\n\nStudying these fragments may reveal valuable new insights into the construction of the Portes-L."
anomaly.35.desc_b:0 "A small scout craft of some kind plowed into the surface of this asteroid millennia ago, creating a shallow canyon. There is no visible cockpit on the ship, but Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has salvaged the remains of a complex navigational computer network, suggesting the craft was piloted by an artificial intelligence. Both the computer and the ship itself are too damaged to salvage, but we can learn much form their design."
anomaly.55.desc_b:0 "Upon closer examination, we have discovered that a smaller asteroid consisting almost entirely of precious metals recently collided with [From.GetName]. This small but dense cache of metals was hidden just beneath the asteroid's surface. In addition to the main deposit, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has located several smaller deposits of strategically important metals surrounding the crater.\n\nNow that these deposits have been discovered, they should be easily accessible to mining."
anomaly.55.b:0 "A very lucky find."
anomaly.60.desc_b:0 "This particular asteroid is an extrasolar capture, and appears to have been washed by some kind of exotic radiation as it plummeted through interstellar space before finally settling in the [From.GetStarName] system.

The Sujin were obsessed with the gateway network, and according to recovered logs, they had recently attempted to hijack the network using some kind of interference beam. Unfortunately for the Sujin, they were interrupted by a well-timed attack by one of their rivals. The Sujin sent this fleet here in retaliation, although it is unclear from the remains who was the victor.\n\nOf particular note is the armored plating used by the Sujin vessels, which is not dissimilar to that used by the enigmatic §HGatebuilders§!. They must have discovered additional Gatebuilder technology, and managed to reverse-engineer some of it for their own purposes. Analyzing their designs may give us new insights into Gatebuilder technologies."

Curiously, although the targeting  computers report downing many Naar-Di-Shav ships, only the wreckage of Gatebuilder ships have been identified.\n\nAnalyzing the Gatebuilder wreckage in conjunction with other insights into the ancient Gateway Builders may yield valuable data on how these Portes-L could be reactivated."

distar.9000.lcluster_clue_bunker_bot:0 "Further studies into the subterranean mega-computer's database have recovered partial logs that reveal new insights into the system's function. According to the logs, the system's original makers had discovered one of the §HPortes-L§! within their territory. They had programmed the mega-computer to find a way to abort this process and open the gate. It is unclear how the computer's current calculations are related to its original task, if at all, but studying its calculations in conjunction with other insights into the Portes-L may yield valuable data on how they could be reactivated."
distar.9000.lcluster_clue_asteroid_gate:0 "We have discovered that the gateway uncovered in the [asteroid_gate.GetName] System is noticeably less damaged than other gateways, likely due to its protective shell.

The data these so-called deviants sent back only seemed to strengthen their view of the Bubble's superiority.\n\nDespite their unwillingness to settle outside the Bubble, their immediate neighbors appeared to have no designs on their space, allowing them to develop in peaceful isolation. Habitats like this one sprang up across the system to support their growing population. They even constructed a massive Science Nexus in the outer solar system, although nothing of this installation has survived to the modern day.\n\nCenturies of peaceful existence was finally shattered when their neighbor, the Republic of Alaria, was devoured by a ravenous hive mind. With invasion imminent, the Praath unleashed their final line of defense and shielded their own homeworld! The swarm, angry at being denied a meal, destroyed most of the Praath's habitats and blasted their science nexus to dust. The Praath have lived under their protective bubble ever since."

The creature is terrifying to look at, seemingly composed of nothing but teeth and claws, and ravenously devours any matter that gets too close to any of its many mouth parts. As described in field reports from the Mirror-Dimension, the Warp beast's hide forms a natural armor that is highly resistant to weapon damage, and its mouths produce a highly acidic saliva that it uses as a potent weapon.\n\nA major breakthrough was made when the beast was moved to one of our secure facilities for a sensitive experiment. After passing through the dimensional portal, it soon became less aggressive, acting with confusion and mild irritation at its new environment. Our researchers speculate that since we use hyperdrives, our universe lacks the characteristic Warp signatures that woke the beasts in the Mirror-Dimension. Once we uncovered the biological mechanisms responsible for detecting subspace signatures, we were able to construct a device capable of disrupting these sensory organs, rendering the beasts temporarily disoriented. Used tactically, such a device could be devastating against Warp beast fleets. The only limitation is the massive power requirements, meaning it can only be equipped on large ships.\n\nOur counterparts in the Mirror-Dimension are delighted with our results, and have already begun constructing specially-designed ships for deployment against the Warp beasts."

countryexpanded.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! I have been asked to approach you on behalf of the Baldarak Science Academy about a matter of great importance. We have been pondering possibilities for the future, and many in the Academy have expressed concerns over some hostile race doing harm to us, as they once did to Tollok Rong. As much as we appreciate your rescue, we cannot leave our future at the mercy of benevolent solids.\n\nWe would like to develop a means to protect ourselves from any future unpleasantness. Sadly, the Science Academy does not have the equipment to study the matter properly. If you'd be so kind, could you send one of your science ships to Tollok Rong?"
countryexpanded.1.a:0 "Very well."
countryexpanded.1.a.response:0 "Excellent! Our scientists will fill you in on what they're looking for."
countryexpanded.1.b.response:0 "I... see. How unfortunate. I suppose we'll have to make the best of it, then."
countryexpanded.2.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has completed a full scan of Tollok Rong. The damage to the planet is extensive and irreparable, but our contact within the Baldarak Science Academy seems pleased with the results nonetheless."
countryexpanded.3.desc:0 "Thank you, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! The amount of data you collected is beyond our wildest expectations. With this we should be able to get a clear model of precisely how Tollok Rong was poisoned, and from there we can figure out ways to prevent it.\n\nWe couldn't have done this without you. Please allow us to share our findings with you. We hope they will be of use."
countryexpanded.3.a:0 "Glad we could help."
countryexpanded.4.desc:0 "Hello again, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], on behalf of the Baldarak Science Academy. We have been trying to develop protective systems using the data you collected from Tollok Rong, but we have become bogged down in calculations. You solids have rather advanced calculation machines, I've come to understand. It it's not too much to ask, could we borrow them? It would hasten our research immensely."
countryexpanded.4.a.response:0 "Thank you. We'll try not to be too intrusive."
countryexpanded.4.b:0 "Absolutely not!"
countryexpanded.4.b.response:0 "Very well, we knew it was a lot to ask. We'll just have to do this the hard way."
countryexpanded.5.desc:0 "Hello from the Baldarak Science Academy! We have recently made a breakthrough in our planetary protection project, and we now have a prototype ready for testing.\n\nIf you could lend us a science ship, we know a nearby world that is perfect for experimentation."
countryexpanded.5.a:0 "Very well."
countryexpanded.5.a.response:0 "We'll send you the coordinates right away!"
countryexpanded.5.b:0 "Our science ships are busy."
countryexpanded.5.b.response:0 "When would be a better time, then? We're free all next millennium. No? Well, perhaps the nice people at the [horrible_alternative.GetRealName] will be more helpful."
countryexpanded.6.desc:0 "We applied the Dathnak's strange concoction into [dathnak_test_planet_1.GetName]'s atmosphere. Supposedly it was designed to neutralize harmful radiation, but it neutralized the planet's atmosphere instead. After only a week, the entire atmosphere disappeared, leaving only a mineral rich frozen core behind."
countryexpanded.6.a:0 "Well that was unexpected."
countryexpanded.7.desc:0 "We applied the Dathnak's strange concoction into [dathnak_test_planet_1.GetName]'s atmosphere. Supposedly it was designed to neutralize harmful radiation, but it neutralized the planet's atmosphere instead. After only a week, the entire atmosphere disappeared, leaving behind a frozen core rich in rare crystals."
countryexpanded.8.desc:0 "Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. This is a disaster! Oh, I'm going to have nightmares about this for the rest of my days. \n\nI'm sorry, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], that wasn't meant to happen. We'll have to develop something else. We will contact you when we have a new prototype ready."
countryexpanded.8.a:0 "Very well."
countryexpanded.9.desc:0 "Greetings! We have perfected a new prototype for you to try. We have high hopes for this. If all goes well, it should protect us from all sorts of nastiness. Assuming the ventral nanowave modulator doesn't... nevermind, not important.\n\nWe've picked out another world to try it on, if we could borrow a science ship."
countryexpanded.9.a:0 "... Fine."
countryexpanded.9.a.response:0 "Splendid! We'll send the coordinates."
countryexpanded.9.b:0 "No, this is madness!"
countryexpanded.9.b.response:0 "Madness? This is science!"
countryexpanded.10.desc:0 "With some trepidation, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] turned the Dathnak's prototype device on [dathnak_test_planet_2.GetName]. To everyone's amazement, the gas giant disappeared under a sickly green shield. Repeated testing showed the shield to be impenetrable."
countryexpanded.11.desc:0 "Marvelous! It all went well above expectations. And it didn't even catch fire! Of course now we need to find a way to turn it off, but we can cross that jet stream when we come to it.\n\nHere, let us send you a copy of all our research. Perhaps you can use it to protect your own worlds from fiery Armageddon."
countryexpanded.11.a:0 "Happy we could be of assistance."
countryexpanded.11.a.response:0 "We should have our final prototype ready soon. Keep safe, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
countryexpanded.12.desc:0 "Greetings, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! The Baldarak Science Academy has been hard at work improving our prototype, and they have finally developed a design they are satisfied with.\n\nWe have one final test that we need your help with."
countryexpanded.12.a:0 "Well, we came this far."
countryexpanded.12.a.response:0 "That's the spirit! I'm sure you know what to expect by now. Coordinates on their way."
countryexpanded.13.desc:0 "The Dathnak's prototype, despite looking like it could explode at any moment, performed exactly as expected. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] was able to repeatedly shield and unshield the gas giant, much to the delight of our Dathnak contacts."
countryexpanded.14.desc:0 "That was exquisite! Everything we could ever hope for. Never again will we have to fear a slow death from angry solids! What a relief this is.\n\nThank you so much for all your help, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. We couldn't have done this without you."
countryexpanded.14.a:0 "You're welcome."
countryexpanded.14.a.response:0 "We can take this from here. Thank you again!"
countryexpanded.15.name:0 "Dathnak Computing"
countryexpanded.15.desc:0 "We have recently had an interesting development with one of the Dathnak scientists using our computers. She approached our scientists, gas tank and all, to tell them of a breakthrough she had that could improve our computer systems. She wished to share this knowledge with the [Root.GetName] as a sign of gratitude."
countryexpanded.15.a:0 "Well that was surprisingly useful."


countryexpanded.20.name:0 "Damaged Ecosystem"
countryexpanded.20.desc:0 "Our first steps into the stars beyond §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! was not merely born out of a desire for exploration, or to conquer the unknown, or a need to leave our mark on the galaxy.\n\nCenturies of relentless economic and industrial exploitation have extracted a terrible price from our homeworld. Industrial pollutants have drastically changed our planet's climate, sparking a mass extinction event the likes of which had not been seen in millions of years.\n\nAlthough we have tried to adapt our society so as to not damage §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! further, many fear that we are living on borrowed time. We need to spread to the stars to ensure the survival of our species."
countryexpanded.21.name:0 "Saving §Y[Root.GetName]§!"
countryexpanded.21.desc:0 "With the recent development of advanced terraforming technology, scientists on §Y[Root.GetName]§! are abuzz with the possibility of restoring the planet's long damaged ecosystem. The people call out for the renewal of our once great home."
countryexpanded.22.name:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! Restored"
countryexpanded.22.desc:0 "With the project complete, the ecology of §Y[Root.GetName]§! has been restored as best as can be. The flora and fauna of the planet, both native and imported, have come to flourish. In many places, this is the first time our citizens could breathe the unfiltered air in centuries. While the homeworld can never be returned to what it once was, the citizens of §Y[Root.Owner.GetName]§! greatly appreciate our efforts."
countryexpanded.23.name:0 "Ecological Deterioration"
countryexpanded.23.desc:0 "The situation on the homeworld has gotten steadily worse, and now we are facing a critical mass extinction event on §Y[Root.GetName]§!! Without some sort of intervention, §Y[Root.GetName]§! could become uninhabitable within decades."
countryexpanded.23.a:0 "We must do something!"
countryexpanded.24.name:0 "Ecological Disaster"
countryexpanded.24.desc:0 "The ecological deterioration on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has reached a critical tipping point. Run-away climate change and mass extinction has irrevocably damaged our homeworld, turning the planet into a lifeless husk. Maybe one day we can resurrect the corpse of §Y[Root.GetName]§!, but our homeworld as we knew it is forever gone."

countryexpanded.30.name:0 "Ghosts of the Past"
countryexpanded.30.desc:0 "The hyperlanes were not our first attempt at faster-than-light travel. Over a century ago, an unstable wormhole was discovered beyond the Oort Cloud, just barely within reach with the current technologies. Excited at the possibilities, the United Nations sponsored the Ulysses Initiative to study the wormhole, and to develop a means to traverse it.\n\nIn 2087, the Ulysses Initiative managed to send an unmanned probe to the [colony_system_2.GetName] System, transmitting back to Earth for the first time a view of an alien world. Bolstered by a wave of popular support, within two decades a half-dozen ark ships carrying a quarter-million colonists each braved the wormhole in search of a new home.\n\nNone were ever heard from again. A few days after the last ark ship went through, the wormhole collapsed in on itself and disappeared, but not before spitting up half of one of the missing ark ships. This brought an end to the Ulysses Initiative, and halted FTL research until the discovery of the hyperlanes decades later. Most humans have long forgotten the lost ark ships, but some still wonder if they might still be out there, somewhere."
countryexpanded.30.a:0 "We will find them, if we can."
countryexpanded.30.a.tooltip:0 "Begins the Ghosts of the Past Event Chain"
countryexpanded.31.a.desc:0 "We have arrived in the [Root.Solar_System.GetName] System. The original scientists working on the Ulysses Initiative were hopeful that [Root.Solar_System.GetName] contained a suitably habitable planet, but initial scans suggest that the system is lifeless. Long range sensors have detected an anomaly on the barren world [colony_planet_1.GetName], possibly the remains of one of our colony ships."
countryexpanded.31.b.desc:0 "We have arrived in the [Root.Solar_System.GetName] System. The Ulysses Initiative sent several unmanned probes to test their wormhole technology, but it was the probe to this system that is most remembered. It was here that humanity caught its first glimpse of what might have been a habitable world beyond Sol. Named Elpis after the Greek personification of hope, our scans have confirmed what the Ulysses Initiative could only have suspected: a planet hospitable to human life. If any of the colony ships have survived, it will be here."
countryexpanded.31.c.desc:0 "We have arrived in the [Root.Solar_System.GetName] System. While initial scans did not pick up any signs of the ark ship, they did detect an anomaly around the system's star. We should investigate."
countryexpanded.31.d.desc:0 "We have arrived in the [Root.Solar_System.GetName] System. One of the ark ships should have arrived here, but our sensors have picked up no signs of it. After a day of tireless work, our scientists eventually concluded that the ship must have been flung off course and ended up elsewhere.\n\nWhile the [Root.Solar_System.GetName] System is a dead end, we can use the sensor data from the [Root.GetName] back on Earth to triangulate where the ark ship might have gone."
countryexpanded.31.a:0 "Let's start searching."
countryexpanded.32.name:0 "The Coriaria"
countryexpanded.32.a.desc:0 "We have found the wreckage of the Coriaria. It appears that the ship landed on [From.From.GetName] in a desperate attempt to set up a colony on [From.From.GetName]'s barren soil. We found evidence of makeshift hydroponic farms and oxygen converters, but eventually the equipment failed, dooming the colonists."
countryexpanded.32.b.desc:0 "We have found the wreckage of the Coriaria on [From.From.GetName]. Strangely, it appears that most of the damage to the ship was not sustained from the crash. The hull shows evidence of sustained damaged consistent with kinetic and laser weaponry. Whatever attacked the Coriaria, there is no sign of it now."
countryexpanded.32.c.desc:0 "We have found the wreckage of the Coriaria on [From.From.GetName]. Strangely, despite signs of irreparable damage to the life support system, the ship contains no corpses. Our science officers speculate that the colonists were rescued by an unknown alien race, although there is no sign of where they might have been taken."
countryexpanded.32.d.desc:0 "We have found the wreckage of the Coriaria on [From.From.GetName]. Strangely, it appears that most of the damage to the ship was not sustained from the crash. The hull shows evidence of sustained damage consistent with laser weaponry.\n\nWhile the [Root.GetName] was analyzing the debris, they detected a sudden energy signature coming from the surface. It appears that the enemy that destroyed the Coriaria is still here, and has become alert to our presence."
countryexpanded.32.d:0 "Evasive Maneuvers!"
countryexpanded.33.name:0 "The Persea"
countryexpanded.33.a.desc:0 "We have managed to find the wreckage of the Persea. From the recovered ship logs, it appears that the Persea was heavily damaged during transit, and was forced to crash land on Elpis. The Persea burned up in the planet's atmosphere, killing all aboard."
countryexpanded.33.b.desc:0 "We have found evidence that the Persea successfully managed to land on Elpis and found the beginnings of a colony there. However, according to the surviving logs, the new colony was surrounded on all sides by dangerous wildlife, who relentlessly attacked the colony until it was finally destroyed. If there were any survivors, we have yet to find them."
countryexpanded.33.c.desc:0 "We have found evidence that the Persea successfully managed to land on Elpis and found the beginnings of a colony there. However, according to the surviving logs, the colonists accidentally upset the titanic lifeforms living on the planet. Once angered, the massive beasts relentlessly attacked the colony until it was finally destroyed. If there were any survivors, we have yet to find them."
countryexpanded.33.d.desc:0 "Survivors found on Elpis! Not only did the original ark ship, the Persea, survive, but they managed to create a thriving colony. They have set up a technocratic government, ruled by a council of leading scientists. The colony has tried to get back into contact with Earth for a hundred years, but matters of survival took precedent, and their plans to contact us never came to fruition."
countryexpanded.33.e.desc: "We have discovered a primitive civilization living on Elpis! It seems a century ago, the ark ship Persea crash landed on their homeworld, and have since integrated themselves into the alien's society. What's more, the aliens have noticed our presence, and are making attempts to contact us by radio."
countryexpanded.33.f.desc:0 "We have found evidence that the Persea successfully managed to land on Elpis and found the beginnings of a colony there. However, the soil was much poorer in nutrients than expected, and the colonists had trouble producing enough food. This eventually lead to civil strife and food riots that tore the fledgling colony apart."
countryexpanded.33.f.desc.relic:0 "We have found evidence that the Persea successfully managed to land on Elpis and found the beginnings of a colony there, yet no one could have expected that the world was covered in ancient ruins. With all the arable farmland covered under miles of concrete, the colonists could not producing enough food. This eventually lead to civil strife and food riots that tore the fledgling colony apart."
countryexpanded.33.g.desc:0 "We have found evidence that the Persea successfully managed to land on Elpis and found the beginnings of a colony there. Unfortunately, the planet is host to an invasive fungal lifeform of unknown origin, which blankets the entire biosphere.\n\nAny future settlers on the planet would have to deal with routinely burning back the exofungus - it is unknown at this point if it can be entirely eradicated. Without any means of doing so, the fungus overran the colony. The final fate of the original colonists remains unknown."
countryexpanded.33.h.desc:0 "We have found evidence that the Persea successfully managed to land on Elpis and found the beginnings of a colony there. Unfortunately, the colony seems to have succumbed to the intoxicating hallucinogens in the planet's atmosphere. Over time the colonists became increasingly apathetic, and the colony eventually fell apart from neglect."
countryexpanded.33.a:0 "An ignoble end."
countryexpanded.33.d:0 "Initiate Contact"
countryexpanded.34.desc:0 "Greetings from Elpis, [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]. I am [persean_directory.GetRulerName], [persean_directory.GetRulerTitle] of the Persean Directory. The science council never did lose hope that Earth would come for us, although I never dreamed it would happen in my lifetime."
countryexpanded.34.a:0 "How have you survived for so long?"
countryexpanded.34.a.response:0 "It hasn't been easy on Elpis. Our ancestors almost didn't survive the first few years. We established a council of our best scientists to guide our people through the many difficulties of the last century. Without the council, we fear the colony would have fallen to anarchy and despair long ago."
countryexpanded.34.b:0 "Welcome back, [persean_directory.GetRulerName]."
countryexpanded.34.b.response:0 "We're glad to be back, [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]."
countryexpanded.34.c:0 "We want you to continue administering Elpis, [persean_directory.GetRulerTitle]."
countryexpanded.34.c.response:0 "We understand. We've been apart so long, our cultures must have diverged. It will be easier this way."
countryexpanded.35.desc:0 "Hello? Hello? Is this thing on? Oh, we're picking something up! *Ahem* Greetings! This is Aoi Hayashi, descendant of the original colonists of the Persea. We never expected we would ever hear from Earth again. How exciting!"
countryexpanded.35.a:0 "How have you fared on [colony_elpis.GetName]?"
countryexpanded.35.a.response:0 "Quite well! We have found a purpose helping the [primitive_species.GetName]. Our ancestors taught them so much, and they treat us with respect. When we first arrived a hundred years ago, they had barely just invented the printing press, and now look at them!"
countryexpanded.35.b:0 "We could take you back to Earth."
countryexpanded.35.b.response:0 "Thank you for offering, but no. Earth is a barely-remembered story to most of us. [colony_elpis.GetName] is our home now. Maybe someday we'll visit Earth, but we cannot leave the [primitive_species.GetName] behind."
countryexpanded.35.c:0 "Best of luck, Aoi."
countryexpanded.35.c.response:0 "Farewell! May the Blorg guide your steps, as the [primitive_species.GetNamePlural] would say."
countryexpanded.36.name:0 "Lost Colonists"
countryexpanded.36.desc:0 "Against all odds, some of the original colonists on [Root.GetName] have survived. They had disappeared into the planet's wilderness for over a hundred years before they were discovered by a team of surveyors. They have regressed significantly, having lost access to most of their technology, but they are slowly readapting to [Root.Owner.GetAdj] society."
countryexpanded.36.a:0 "Welcome home."
countryexpanded.37.name:0 "The Impatien"
countryexpanded.37.a.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] has managed to locate the debris of the Impatien. It seems that the ship suffered a cataclysmic failure during FTL, and disintegrated upon arrival. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] speculates that the Ulysses Initiative's wormhole must have already been starting to collapse when the Impatien went through, rendering FTL transit unstable."
countryexpanded.37.b.desc:0 "The Impatien, or what's left of it, shows signs of being viciously attacked. Its attacker physically ripped the ship in two, and the interior can only be described as 'partially digested.' What sort of weapon - or creature - could do such a thing, we can only speculate."
countryexpanded.37.c.desc:0 "Careful analysis of the debris has shown that the Impatien passed straight through the star during FTL transit, instantly disintegrating it. The FTL navigational computer must have malfunctioned, but we can only speculate how it came to fail so spectacularly."
countryexpanded.37.d.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] has managed to locate the debris of the Impatien. Unfortunately, the cause of its destruction cannot be determined. In the intermittent years it was thoroughly looted of anything remotely salvageable by unknown spacefarers, taking with them any clues we might have uncovered."
countryexpanded.38.name:0 "FTL Trajectory Calculated"
countryexpanded.38.a.desc:0 "By combining old data from the Ulysses Initiative with more recent interstellar telemetry, we have managed to calculate where the missing ark ship is most likely to have ended up."
countryexpanded.38.b.desc:0 "Despite months of work, our scientists have not been able to locate the missing ark ship, the Carpinus. It is as if the ship has disappeared from the universe, leaving only fading ripples in its wake. The Carpinus has officially been declared missing in action."
countryexpanded.38.c.desc:0 "Our scientists have finished their analysis of the ark ship telemetry data, and have come to a remarkable realization. The ark ship Carpinus arrived so far away from its initial destination as to have left the Milky Way galaxy entirely. We believe that they arrived somewhere in the Andromeda galaxy, but it is also possible that they landed in the middle of intergalactic space. In either case, they are now far beyond our reach."
countryexpanded.39.desc:0 "We have arrived in the [Root.Solar_System.GetName] System. Our updated calculations indicate that one of the ark ships should have arrived here, and our sensors have picked up an anomaly on [colony_planet_5.GetName] that might be our missing ship. We should investigate further."
countryexpanded.40.name:0 "The Carpinus"
countryexpanded.40.a.desc:0 "Wreckage of the Carpinus can be found strewn across the [Root.Solar_System.GetName] System. It seems that the stress of the unexpected detour was too much for the ship, and it shattered upon entering the system."
countryexpanded.40.b.desc:0 "We have found the descendants of the crew of the Carpinus living among the primitive aliens on [From.From.GetName]. Disturbingly, they seemed to have been enslaved by the alien natives."
countryexpanded.40.c.desc:0 "The Carpinus survived its unexpected detour, only to arrive in a system with no habitable planets. Running out of food, some of the colonists turned to cannibalism to survive. Desperate factions fought amongst themselves for survival until one of them caused a catastrophic failure of the ship's engines, detonating the Carpinus."
countryexpanded.40.d.desc:0 "We have found strewn remnants of the Carpinus in the accretion disk of the black hole. The ark ship appears to have arrived too close to the event horizon and was torn apart."
countryexpanded.40.a:0 "We must save them!"
countryexpanded.41.a.desc:0 "We have managed to track down all the ark ships near Earth. Sadly, none of the ark ships we have found so far have survived. However, there is one last ark ship that has been left unaccounted for: the Chrysanthemum. Records from the Ulysses Initiative suggest that the ship went wildly off course, and we have been unable to piece together where it might have gone. Recently, however, we have been able to pinpoint the approximate location of the Chrysanthemum's supply ship, the Hyacinth. If we are able to find the Hyacinth, the Chrysanthemum will surely be close by."

action.1.desc_90.b:0 "The [From.GetName]... So not only has the UN managed to somehow maintain its grasp on power, but it has been co-opted by alien infiltrators. The situation on Earth was so chaotic when our ancestors departed on the Ulysses ark ships, we feared if humanity didn't destroy themselves by war, they would be ripe for alien conquest. Now I see our fears were well founded.\n\nWe have a message to the illegitimate despots squatting on [From.Capital.GetName]: Our ancestors built the [contact_empire.GetName] out of nothing, and we will defend it and all of [From.GetSpeciesName]-kind to the last.
