 # Hollow Asteroid gpm_hollow_structure
 gpm_survey_minor.1.name:0 "Hollowed Asteroid"
 gpm_survey_minor.1.desc:0 "Our science ship has found a strange asteroid during it's survey of the system §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§!. The asteroid, now named, §H[From.GetName]§! is hollow! Not only just that, it looks like it has a small hole on in it, as if something got in and hollowed it out. Or something got out that used to be inside.."
 # Crystallized Asteroid gpm_crystallized_structure
 gpm_survey_minor.5.name:0 "Crystallized Asteroid"
 gpm_survey_minor.5.desc:0 "Unusual crystals appear to be protruding from the asteroid named §H[From.GetName]§! in the solar system §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§!. The science ship §H[root.GetName]§! has identified the crystals unusual, but natural forming. It is theorised this asteroid was part of a large moon at some point in it's life. The crystals are the result of intense heat and pressure from when this asteroid was still a deep part in this moon."
 # Abandoned Mining Platforms gpm_abandoned_mining_platforms
 gpm_survey_minor.10.name:0 "Derelict Platforms"
 gpm_survey_minor.10.desc:0 "Several mining platforms are attached to the large asteroid §H[From.GetName]§! in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system. Held together by chains and hooks, these platforms have several drill arms that can be remotely operated. A small bay has already been carved out of the asteroid likely to be used as a storage area for newly mined minerals until they can be picked up. It looks like whoever started mining this asteroid left in a hurry, leaving the platforms surprisingly intact."
 # gpm_hydrogen_mist
 gpm_survey_minor.15.name:0 "Flowing Hydrogen Mist"
 gpm_survey_minor.15.desc:0 "Thick flowing rivers of hydrogen can be seen flowing over the surface of §H[From.GetName]§!. An unusual combination of low atmospheric pressure and static attraction from the world's surface rocks produce these elegent, slow moving, rivers of dense hydrogen gas."
 # gpm_salt_flats
 gpm_survey_minor.20.name:0 "Expansive Salt Flats"
 gpm_survey_minor.20.desc:0 "Endlessly stretching plains of salt crystals have been spotted on §H[From.GetName]§!! The science ship §H[root.GetName]§! in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system speculates the world must have once been an ocean planet. A planet covered almost entirely in salt water. What happened to all this water is a mystery however. There is no natural phenomenon that can explain the disappearance of that much water. Something, or someone, must have remove all of it."
 # gpm_relic_lower_levels
 gpm_survey_minor.25.name:0 "Cities Build On Cities"
 gpm_survey_minor.25.desc:0 "Part of the massive endless city that is §H[From.GetName]§! has collapsed revealing that the top layer of the city planet is build on an much older city. Instead of demolishing the original city, or converting the many buildings to more modern ones, they build a giant massive platform on top of it along with new cities on that! Preposterous and insane engineering to say the least."
 # gpm_water_pockets
 gpm_survey_minor.30.name:0 "There's life but not as we know it!"
 gpm_survey_minor.30.desc:0 "§H[root.GetName]§! in the solar system of §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! reports trace amounts of dung have been found in an underground cavern along with small streams of liquid water. It appears some form of life exists on this otherwise dead planet. What is living here has unspiritually thus far eluded us."
 gpm_survey_minor.MEGACORPSELL_DUNG:0 "Sell the dung!"
 
 # gpm_geometrical_polar_storm
 gpm_survey_minor.35.name:0 "Edgy Storm"
 gpm_survey_minor.35.desc:0 "Our exploration of §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system is going slower than anticipated duo to the discovery of a spectacular polar storm on §H[root.GetName]§!. The storm is perfectly shaped like a pentagon. A very unique pressure and wind process have shaped this near endlessly lasting storm into a perfect geometric shape."
 # gpm_floating_forest
 gpm_survey_minor.40.name:0 "Floating Trees"
 gpm_survey_minor.40.desc:0 "A deep scan of the gas giant §H[From.GetName]§! has revealed a strange new undiscovered phenomenon. Spread out across the gas giants upper gas layer are small pockets of floating flora. Small islands of roots and vegetation, most in tree form. The leaves and branches are huge and extremely light and sway with every gust of wind. The flowers are shaped like giant, semi-transparent elongated balloons. They giant floaty leaves simultaneously absorb the little sunlight they get and the various base chemicals found in the gas giant."
 # gpm_viscous_gas_layer
 gpm_survey_minor.45.name:0 "Gas or Liquid?"
 gpm_survey_minor.45.desc:0 "The atmosphere of §H[From.GetName]§! is so dense it mimics the flow of a liquid. While extremely improbably for a gas giant to have such dense gas it is not impossible. It is believed a combination of high gravity, and very fast planetary spin and extreme counter motion in the gas giants atmosphere is the reason for this unusual phenomenon."
 # gpm_everlasting_tornadoes
 gpm_survey_minor.50.name:0 "Eternal Tornadoes"
 gpm_survey_minor.50.desc:0 "Deep within the atmosphere of the gas giant §H[From.GetName]§! in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system rage extremely longlasting tornadoes. These massive vortexes move in the other direction the planet is spinning at roughly the same speed making them look like they never move. On top of that, the science ship §H[root.GetName]§! has so far never seen a vortex like this disappear. It seems like they last forever too."
 # gpm_shrinking_giant
 gpm_survey_minor.55.name:0 "Tiny Giant"
 gpm_survey_minor.55.desc:0 "§H[root.GetName]§! has discovered a unusual small gas giant. It appears the violent solar winds from the main star in §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! are the cause of this strange tiny giant. These powerful solar winds have, over the course of millions of years, stripped most of the outer and middle layer of the gas giant's gaseous atmosphere."
 # gpm_aeroplankton_clouds
 gpm_survey_minor.60.name:0 "Clouds of Life"
 gpm_survey_minor.60.desc:0 "Large green clouds can be seen from far away when looking at the gas giant §H[From.GetName]§!. It's vibrant green is in star contrast with the white-yellowish cloud layers and the dark brown bands of denser gas. Our science ship §H[root.GetName]§!, currently surveying the system of §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§!, has discovered these green clouds are actually a life form! Tiny plankton like lifeforms float across the upper layers of the gas giant, absorbing both the gasses and sunlight in order to grow, multiply and survive."
 # gpm_abandoned_refineries
 gpm_survey_minor.65.name:0 "Abandoned Cloud Refineries"
 gpm_survey_minor.65.desc:0 "Deep-Echo scans from the science ship §H[root.GetName]§! have revealed various structures floating in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant §H[From.GetName]§!. These abandoned structures, presumably refineries, seem to be autonomously sucking in gas at the bottom and processing it into raw solid materials. After which it is storing the materials in giant hexacylinder tanks. Most of the tanks on the structures appear to be broken, burst from within, duo tot the pressure build up of excess of materials. We might be able to recover some of the resources in a few of the refineries."
 # gpm_floating_kelp
 gpm_survey_minor.70.name:0 "Floating Kelp"
 gpm_survey_minor.70.desc:0 "The gas giant §H[From.GetName]§! seems to have colossal kelp-like flora floating in it's upper atmosphere. These floating kelp are hundreds of meters long and have giant leaves all tightly winded around a central tube filled with plant sap. These tubes seem to easily transport the absorbed gasses from the leaves up to the lengthy translucent roots where sunlight converts it into nutrients."
 # gpm_super_heated_atmosphere
 gpm_survey_minor.75.name:0 "Scorching Gasses"
 gpm_survey_minor.75.desc:0 "The temperature of §H[From.GetName]§! is several magnitudes higher than what is expected for this type of gas giant. It appears an unusual dense core of an unknown material is producing a lot of heat. The atmosphere is so hot our probes are unable to reach the inner part of the gas giant to study what the core could be made out of. "
 # gpm_floatig_behemothaurs
 gpm_survey_minor.80.name:0 "Ancient Behemothaur"
 gpm_survey_minor.80.desc:0 "Occasionally surfacing in the upper atmosphere of §H[From.GetName]§! in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! are ancient Behemothaurs. These hyper intelligent creatures are several millions years old and are home to entire ecosystems of symbiotic fauna and flora. Some of these organisms are able to interface directly with their home Behemothaur in special chambers, in order to share information with their host. Certain animals are sometimes given the role of Interpreter, serving as liaisons between visiting sentient life and the Behemothaur itself."
 # gpm_magma_ocean
 gpm_survey_minor.85.name:0 "Magma Ocean"
 gpm_survey_minor.85.desc:0 "The planet §H[From.GetName]§! deep within the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! solar system seems to have a giant ocean of magma. An endless stretch of liquid molten rock. Deep resonance scans indicate part of the core is fully exposed in this area which explains how the magma can stay so hot and liquid."
 # gpm_heavy_elements
 gpm_survey_minor.90.name:0 "Vital Elements"
 gpm_survey_minor.90.desc:0 "A strange phenomenon deep in the core of §H[From.GetName]§! has resulted in a lot of minerals and chemicals fusing and reacting together to form very rare heavy elements. The constant tectonic activity has pushed most of those to the surface. With proper equipment this could provide a good addition to our mining efforts."
 # gpm_rare_metals
 gpm_survey_minor.95.name:0 "Precious Metals"
 gpm_survey_minor.95.desc:0 "The solar system §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! is home to a very tame and stable star. This was not the case billions of years ago, when another star had it's home here. With the death of this other star a lot of rare and precious metals were formed. These metals then started coalesce into small chunks, which then turned into bigger asteroids, until they eventually became a proto-planet. This planet is now called §H[From.GetName]§! and has a substantial amount of precious resources"
 # gpm_proto_planet
 gpm_survey_minor.100.name:0 "Proto Planet"
 gpm_survey_minor.100.desc:0 "According to §H[root.prev.GetName]§! on the science ship §H[root.GetName]§! the planet of §H[From.GetName]§! is a proto-planet. A very young planet, barely a million years old. Much much younger than the other planets in this system. The exact nature of how this planet came to be so late is unknown and worthy of investigation."
 # gpm_flat_terrain or gpm_flat_terrain_nb
#  gpm_survey_minor.105.name:0 "Flatter Than Flat"
#  gpm_survey_minor.105.desc:0 "captain we found cool space shit"
 # gpm_old_world or gpm_old_world_nb
 gpm_survey_minor.110.name:0 "The Old World"
 gpm_survey_minor.110.desc:0 "Home to buried, decrepit buildings, §H[From.GetName]§! use to be inhabited by a forgotten civilisation. It is unclear how far this civilisation advanced, though it is believed it has never gotten beyond the age of swords and spears. Large broken down stone buildings, half buried palaces and crumbling walls were found, but no sign of steel or any advanced building material. How the life of such a young civilisation was snuffed out is unclear."
 # gpm_solidified_core
 gpm_survey_minor.115.name:0 "Dead Planet"
 gpm_survey_minor.115.desc:0 "When the science ship §H[root.GetName]§! tried to do a standard tectonic scan on the planet §H[From.GetName]§! as part of it's survey routine, it got no results. Most specifically, it got one result: this planet is dead. The core of this world has completely cooled and solidified into a single ball of dense iron and magnesium. It's theorised that, even with the most advanced of technologies, it would be impossible to make this world liveable by terraforming it."
 # gpm_subterranean_eco_system
 gpm_survey_minor.120.name:0 "Life, Uh.. Finds A Way"
 gpm_survey_minor.120.desc:0 "A large, mostly sealed, cavern system has been found on §H[From.GetName]§!. A small drone of ours had penetrated the surface of this world to do a mineral and soil study and stumbled upon this cave system by accident. To all our surprise, it is filled with life! A sprawling self-sustaining eco-system has managed to survive here. This world must have supported a much wider variety of life at some point in it's life cycle."
 # gpm_plasma_tornadoes
 gpm_survey_minor.125.name:0 "Plasma Whirls"
 gpm_survey_minor.125.desc:0 "The unusual active corona from the star §H[From.GetName]§! helps create large vortices  whenever the star of the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! solar system ejects material through it's solar flares. Large local disruptions in the magnetosphere are causing particles and plasma to then return to the star in swirling patters, creating massive slow rotating plasma vortices."
 # gpm_singing_star
 gpm_survey_minor.130.name:0 "Star Of The Opera"
 gpm_survey_minor.130.desc:0 "While scanning the star §H[From.GetName]§! our science ship's onboard computers quickly detected repeating patterns in the radio-frequency signals it emanates. An engineer recognised some of these patterns from a piece of music it once observed. This engineer proceeded to convert the patterns using a particular clear instrument and managed to produce quite a unique sound. A full recording of these patterns has produced quite a beautiful sounding piece of music. With the right equipment, you can practically hear this star sing!"
 # gpm_precursor_star_filter
 gpm_survey_minor.135.name:0 "Ancient Disco Star"
 gpm_survey_minor.135.desc:0 "Millions of colossal transparent panels seem to be floating in hundreds of different orbits around the star §H[From.GetName]§!. Each series of panels in each orbit seem to each block certain specific wave-lengths of the light causing the star to emit different coloured light onto the planets of the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system. A beautiful display and a spectacular feat of engineering. This can only be the work of a hyper-advanced alien civilisation."
 # gpm_lingering_pollution
 gpm_survey_minor.140.name:0 "Toxic Fumes"
 gpm_survey_minor.140.desc:0 "The atmosphere of §H[From.GetName]§! is heavily polluted with various greenhouse gasses. Large abandoned facilities on the surface of this world appear to have been the cause of this pollution. Whatever civilisation left these structures behind has been really irresponsible with taking care of this world. For shame!"
 # gpm_decaying_structures
 gpm_survey_minor.145.name:0 "Forgotten Ruins"
 gpm_survey_minor.145.desc:0 "Several ruins have been found on §H[From.GetName]§! in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system. Most of the ruins are buried and the ones that aren't have eroded so much they are barely recognizable. The ruins depict various pictures and writing, most of which is a record of their culture. There is a common theme in each of the different depictions, "remember us". It seems this culture knew they were fading away. All wanted was to be remembered. It looks like no one has for millions of years."
 gpm_survey_minor.145.a:0 "We will remember"
 # gpm_heavy_metal_coral
 gpm_survey_minor.150.name:0 "Metal Coral"
 gpm_survey_minor.150.desc:0 "Large reefs of metallic coral have been observed on §H[From.GetName]§!. A metal rich ocean floor has created a very vibrantly coloured coral that is extremely strong and able to withstand extreme pressure. Because of this, the metal coral can be observed on most of the ocean floor."
 # gpm_decomposing_leviathan
 gpm_survey_minor.155.name:0 "Final Resting Place"
 gpm_survey_minor.155.desc:0 "A colossal leviathan lays dead. The world named §H[From.GetName]§! its final resting place. This magnificent, and probably dangerous, creature was attacked by what appears to have been a much larger monster. Large chunks were torn from the leviathans side and back. It must have tried to hide close to the atmosphere of this world, ultimately failing in its attempt."
 # gpm_giant_mold_blobs
 gpm_survey_minor.160.name:0 "Colossal Mold"
 gpm_survey_minor.160.desc:0 "Collosal blobs of mold are seen growing on moist areas of the planet §H[From.GetName]§! in the solar system §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§!. These blobs have a light grey colour and seem to be consuming minerals and metals from the top layer of the soil. Every so often they burst open releasing trillions of spores into the atmosphere."
 # gpm_toxic_garbage or gpm_garbage_dump
 gpm_survey_minor.165.name:0 "Someone Else's Problem"
 gpm_survey_minor.165.desc:0 "It looks like some uncaring civilisation has used §H[From.GetName]§! as a dumping ground for its toxic waste. Billions of tons of radioactive, caustic and toxic metals and chemicals have been dumped spread across the surface of this world. Most of the dumping must have been done from orbit for it to have been so spread out. Cleaning this up seems like an impossible task."
