 apsr.2001.title:0 "The Abyss: Beginning"
 apsr.2001.desc:0 "Good news! The mine that can extract minerals from the Abyss has been successfully completed. For now, only the deposits lying close to the surface are exploited, but by developing our technologies we will be able to reach deeper. \nThis event is overshadowed by the only one thing - some brave souls descended into the depths of the Abyss and disappeared; probes were sent in search of them  but those disappeared as well. As if the Abyss does not want us to find something..."
 apsr.2001.ok-button:0 "Issue a special order prohibiting any furter manned probes into the Abyss" 
 
 apsr.2002.title:0 "The Abyss: Path to Nowhere"
 apsr.2002.desc:0 "The mine continues expanding deeper into the Abyss. Just a little deeper, we have found some richer deposits of minerals. Perhaps further in the depths there are even more minerals! We need to develop our technologies and expand the mine. \nAll the probes sent deep into the Abyss seem to disappear completely. Furthermore, our Abyss has become famous in other empires, and lots of creatures are trying to start their own businesses in the Abyss. Some manage to open a mine, others disappear, as before. We wonder what kind of secret the Abyss hides..."
 apsr.2002.ok-button:0 "It is necessary to solve this riddle"
 
 apsr.2003.title:0 "The Abyss: Only Forward"
 apsr.2003.desc:0 "Now the Abyssal Mine is the deepest mine not only in our empire, but in the entire known galaxy. The deeper we descend, the richer mineral deposits we find. If this goes on, the Abyssal Mine can become an almost inexhaustible source of resources for our empire! \nWe have registered less attempts to penetrate the Abyss, most likely the previous failures scared all the newcomers away. It would be useful to investigate the depths of the Abyss that are accessible to us and to find out how we can get deeper."
 apsr.2003.ok-button:0 "Allocate funds for research!"
 
 apsr.2004.title:0 "The Abyss: Depth"
 apsr.2004.desc:0 "At the depth that we have reached, the very Abyss itself consists of pure minerals. Extracting them is incredibly easy, and the mining process has reached the unprecedented intensity. However, this is not the bottom of the Abyss yet. We need to learn how to build really giant and monumental structures to finally reach the bottom!"
 apsr.2004.ok-button:0 "Soon..."
 
 apsr.2005.title:0 "The Abyss: Reach the bottom"
 apsr.2005.desc:0 "The bottom of the Abyss ... We have not reached it, and probably will not reach in the next few decades. All because the whole unexplored depth is piled up with ships, probes and bodies of daredevils who got inside. Our sensors can not determine where this «cemetery» ends. \nAll the ships descended into the Abyss in a perfect condition, our probes as well. Despite the fact that the probes can be reactivated, there was no recorded information on them. As if they simply disconnected immediately after diving into the Abyss. We could not find the reason or at least a suitable explanation for this. \nThe Hole itself also consists of pure minerals, and that would increase the exploitation level even more. Furthermore, by investigating ships from the Abyss, we can find some interesting engineering solutions."
 apsr.2005.ok-button:0 "Perhaps we would never know the answers, but the Abyss is worth it"
