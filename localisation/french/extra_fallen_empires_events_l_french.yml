 EFE_awaken_trigger.6.desc:0 "Yesterday our instruments detected a subspace signal of immense strength. The signal originated from §H[From.GetName]§! space and appears to have been aimed towards the galactic core. Over the next few hours, scattered reports came in of [From.GetAdjective] fleets vanishing from sensors, entering jump points to familiar systems but never emerging on the other side.\n\nA scout vessel near [From.GetSpeciesName] space was sent to investigate, and reported back startling findings: The ancient machine intelligence has disappeared entirely, leaving behind only abandoned orbital stations, malfunctioning weapons and decaying megastructures.\n\nWhere they have gone to is a mystery we may never solve, but one thing is clear: The task that the [From.GetSpeciesName] set for themselves in ages past is now complete, perhaps they have found the ultimate weapon?"
