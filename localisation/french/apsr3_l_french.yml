Despite its old age the systems hasn't been damaged by any type of erosion and is practically fully preserved. We could possibly use it to simulate advanced scientific models that we've previously only theorized about."

 apsr3_building_part4_text:0 "Sadly, it's impossible to directly connect our minds to the Machine, but we can at-least build a facsimile of a communication channel. This will allow us to use most of its calculation power by connecting it to our Central Processor. Estimations have shown that it will significantly increase the efficiency of our own logical network."
