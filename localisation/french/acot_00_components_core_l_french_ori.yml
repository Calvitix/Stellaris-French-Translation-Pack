CARRIER_AVOID_BEHAVIR_DESC: "§HEvasive Carrier:§! This ship will face itself forward at approaching enemies, if enemies get too close, the ship will attempt to evade and move out of range. This allows the strikecrafts to wither down enemy ships while the mothership avoids retaliation. This however, means that most spinal (XL/T) will not work as the ship will not be facing its front at enemies."
