# I spent a lot of time on this mod out of my own free time, and nobody would like it if someone took their creation
# and stole it, and tried to claim it as their's. If you want to learn to mod Stellaris, I'm not the best person to
# ask, but I'm always open to help and if you'd like to make new features or add-ons to this mod, send me a message,
# and we'll discuss together about either integrating them into this mod, or creating an add-on to this one.

 space_stone.1.desc:0 "Our Lab where the §YSpace Stone§! is being researched exploded today, during an experiment. Many were injured, however, one of our pilots, who had been testing the new §RInfinity Drive§!, was caught in the explosion and was infused with energy from the stone.\n\nOur experts are unable to explain or replicate the phenomena making the pilot one of a kind.\n\nThe pilot, dubbed "§HCaptain Marvel§!" can now fly in space without aid, absorb and expel energy, has super strength and durability and no longer ages.\n\nOur military advisors have suggested we give her a fleet to command for the time being."
 space_stone.1.a:0 "Keep an eye on her."
 space_stone_get_captain_marvel:1 "An admiral named "§HCaptain Marvel§!" has been added to the leader pool."

 space_stone.3.name:0 "The Infinity Drive"
 space_stone.3.desc:0 "Our Efforts have finally paid off we've finally harnessed the power of the §YSpace Stone§!. Our new §RInfinity Drive§! allow us to use the §YSpace Stone§! to open rifts in space and ignore hyperlane restrictions."
 space_stone.3.a:0 "A fantastic outcome!"

 space_stone.4.desc:0 "Our Lab where the §YSpace Stone§! is being researched exploded today, during an experiment. Many were injured, however, one of our drones, who had been testing the new §RInfinity Drive§!, was caught in the explosion and was infused with energy from the stone.\n\nThe collective is unable to explain or replicate the phenomena making the pilot unique.\nThe drone can now fly in space without aid, absorb and expel energy, has super strength and durability and no longer ages.\n\nWe have decided to give them a fleet to command for the time being."
 space_stone.4.a:0 "The deviation will be observed."

 # Moonstone Events
 space_stone.11.name:0 "Captain Marvel"
 space_stone.11.desc:0 "When the §Y[event_target:captain_marvel_creator.GetName]§! has possession of the §BSpace Stone§!, there was an accidental which cause a pilot to be infused with the energy of the stone. Our scientists wish to see if they can replicate the accident to potentially create our own §YCaptain Marvel§!."
 space_stone.11.a:0 "Begin preperations"

 space_stone.12.name:0 "Moonstone"
 space_stone.12.descnotgestalt:0 "Our Lab where the §YSpace Stone§! is being researched exploded today after a break in. A young pilot had heard of the experiment we were conducting and used the equipment for stone infusion on themself.\nThe pilot, now wishing to be called "§HMoonstone§!" can now fly in space without aid, absorb and expel energy, has super strength and durability and no longer ages.\n\nWhilst rewarding this kind of behaviour is not wise, we cannot argue that §HMoonstone§! may be one of our most valuable military assets so we have assigned her a fleet to commmand."

 # Hala events
 hala.0.name:0 "The Imperial Capital"
 hala.0.desc:0 "Upon entering the §HPama§! system, the §Y[Root.GetName]§! has detected structures on the planet §HHala§!. Our sensors detect no sentient life on the planet, yet the entire surface of it has been turned into one city."
 hala.0.a:0 "Could it be ancient civilization?"

 hala_site:0 "Hala Digsite"
 hala_relic_world_site_desc:0 "There are structures of a long-dead civilization on this planet."

 hala.1.name:0 "The City of Kree-Lar"
 hala.1.desc:0 "Upon landing on the surface, we were able to quickly translate the native language. The global city is referred to as "§HKree-Lar§!" named after the race of people who lived there, the §YKree§!.\n\nThe Kree were a race of war-like genetic supremacists, who had a vast empire according to these records. The Kree believed they had reached the height of their evolution, and that all other races were nothing more than animals compared to them. They sought to unify the galaxy under their blue banner; however, it seems they were stopped before that could happen. "
 hala.1.a:0 "Continue the investigation."

 hala.2.name:0 "Kree Technology"
 hala.2.desc:0 "Over thousands of years, wiped out all of there enemies, making themselves the ultimate force in the galaxy. Their technology appears to be a combination of lots of different races technology that they conquered over time.\n\nThe City of §HKree-Lar§! is devoid of life, only plants and insects remain. No animals of any kind can be found across the world, even after all this time. The records of the Kree during the time of there destruction are messy and incomprehensible, like the ramblings of madmen."
 hala.2.a:0 "Salvage anything you can find."

 hala.3.name:0 "The Kree military"
 hala.3.desc:0 "The Kree were protected by two groups; the §YAccuser Corps§! and §YStarforce§!.\nThe §YAccuser Corps§! were mainly the army and navy of the Kree, fighting the Kree's foes throughout space.\n§YStarforce§! were a black ops group, sent on missions that the military couldn't do. The only logs we can find on Hala that make any sense during the end of the Kree appear to be from §YStarforce§!, who were desperately trying to communicate with the planet; however, their communication attempts were manually denied."
 hala.3.a:0 "An interesting find."

 hala.4.name:0 "The Supreme Intelligence"
 hala.4.desc:0 "The Kree were lead by an AI made up of the consciousness of the best minds of their people. They appeared to worship it, as a sort of god, even though they believed they were above that sort of thing. This §YSupreme Intelligence§! had ruled the Kree Empire for hundreds of years before the Kree's destruction.\n\nOur explorers have made it to the chamber in which the Supreme Intelligence was held, only to find it too had been destroyed. However, it's memory banks are intact; therefore, it may still shine some light on what happened."
 hala.4.a:0 "Search its memory, find out what happened."

 hala.5.name:0 "The Space Stone"
 hala.5.desc:0 "After decoding the §YSupreme Intelligence's§! data banks, we uncovered the truth about what happened to the Kree.\n\nThe Kree had been in a gruelling war with another race called the §GSkrulls§!. Although the Kree eventually defeated the Skrulls, their shapeshifting nature left a mark on Kree culture. Although the Skrulls were gone, the Kree slowly lost their ability to trust things, believing they were Skrulls in disguise. First, they genocided the animals of their world, next began the people. Over 90% of the Kree population were wiped out before the Accuser Core tried to restore order to the planet. However, they discovered everything was going according to the Supreme Intelligence's plan.\n\nThe Supreme Intelligence wanted to jumpstart the evolution of the Kree again, by removing the weak, so only the strong survived. It kept putting the idea that the Skrulls were still out there into the heads of the citizens of the empire. When Accuser Core found out about this, they were conflicted. Some stood with the Intelligence, some couldn't stand by and watch as it genocided its own people. Those who resisted the Intelligence were branded Skrulls, and the two sides fought each other into oblivion.\n\nThe conflict resulted in the destruction of the Intelligence, and many of the remaining loyalists killed themselves after its loss. It is unknown what happened to the remaining Kree, but it can be assumed after thousands of years they died out too with the rest of their race.\n\nOn a less sombre note, the data banks also revealed why the Kree were so dominant in the galaxy. They had an infinity stone! The Stone was found powering the Intelligence during the excavation. The §HSpace Stone§! was used by the Kree to create so-called "§RInfinity Drives§!" which allowed for instant travel across the galaxy."
 hala.5.a:0 "We need to build our own §RInfinity Drives§!"
