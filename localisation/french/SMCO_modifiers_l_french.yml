 SMCO_iron_rain:0 "Iron Rain"
 SMCO_iron_rain_desc:0 "This sub-brown dwarf has a high concentration of iron, resulting in iron clouds and rain."
 SMCO_large_moon:0 "Large Rogue Moon"
 SMCO_large_moon_desc:0 "This rogue planet has a moon large enough to heat it via tidal forces."
 SMCO_thick_atmosphere:0 "Thick Atmosphere"
 SMCO_thick_atmosphere_desc:0 "This rogue planet has a thick hydrogen atmosphere, which contributes to heat retention. However, that means the pressure on the planet can be high."
 SMCO_thick_ice:0 "Thick Ice Layer"
 SMCO_thick_ice_desc:0 "This rogue planet has a layer of ice kilometers deep. Liquids may be present beneath that layer if a source of heat exists."

 SMCO_schwarzschild_black_hole_modifier:0 "Schwarzschild Black Hole"
 SMCO_schwarzschild_black_hole_modifier_desc:0 "Schwarzschild black holes possesses neither angular momentum nor electric charge, and can be created from Kerr black holes that has lost enough angular momentum."

 SMCO_kerr_black_hole_modifier:0 "Kerr Black Hole"
 SMCO_kerr_black_hole_modifier_desc:0 "Kerr black holes possesses angular momentum but no electric charge. Unlike Schwarzschild black holes, Kerr black holes have a ring singularity, as well as a region called the ergosphere, where an object within it will never appear to be stationary to a distant observer."

 SMCO_reissner_black_hole_modifier:0 "Reissner-Nordström Black Hole"
 SMCO_reissner_black_hole_modifier_desc:0 "Reissner-Nordström black holes possesses electric charge but no angular momentum. Due to the fact that the force from electromagnetic repulsion is significantly stronger than the force from gravitational attraction, these black holes likely do not have an appreciable electric charge. \n\nHowever, whatever charge these black holes do have seem to attract certain space creatures..."

 SMCO_kerr_newman_black_hole_modifier:0 "Kerr-Newman Black Hole"
 SMCO_kerr_newman_black_hole_modifier_desc:0 "Kerr-Newman black holes possesses both angular momentum and electric charge, and because electromagnetic repulsion is stronger than gravitational attraction, these black holes would likely have miniscule electric charge. \n\nBut what little charge they do have does appear to lure certain space creatures..."

 SMCO_fine_gravity_manipulation:0 "Fine Gravity Manipulation"
 SMCO_fine_gravity_manipulation_desc:0 "Insights from the alien probe allows us to manipulate gravity more precisely and accurately, reducing materials and time needed for construction."

 SMCO_cloud_buff:0 "Void Cloud Buff"
 SMCO_cloud_hunting_buff:0 "Cloud Destroyer"
 SMCO_cloud_hunting_buff_tooltip:0 "Damage to Void Clouds: §G+33%§!"
 SMCO_cloud_hunting_buff_desc:0 "$cloud_hunting_buff_desc$"

 SMCO_void_cloud_damage_plus:0 "Cloud Annihilator"
 SMCO_void_cloud_damage_plus_toolip:0 "Damage to Void Clouds: §G+50%§!\nEnergy Weapon Damage: §G+15%§!\nEnergy Weapon Attack Speed: §G+15%§!"
 SMCO_void_cloud_damage_plus_desc:0 "More detailed studies in the Void Clouds' charging cycles resulted in more precise and accurate weapon tuning to hit them at their weakest, with studies in how they can weaponize their electromagnetic charges being applied to our energy-based weapons, improving their performance."
 SMCO_void_cloud_camo:0 "Void Cloud Camouflage"
 SMCO_void_cloud_camo_desc:0 "Installing electromagnetic emitters that approximate the energies of the Void Clouds tricks them into thinking that our ships are one of them."
