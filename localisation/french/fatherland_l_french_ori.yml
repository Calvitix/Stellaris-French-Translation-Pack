Unlike Rogue Colonies they consider themselves part of your empire, and unless disabled in settings will become a vassal upon formation.

Frontier Worlds can be integrated with relative ease compared to other vassals, and cannot expand or wage war.\n§MHegiran States§!\nIf an empire has the Doomsday Origin and Hegiran States are enabled it will rapidly create Hegiran States up until their homeworld is destroyed. These states will immediately become members of a Hegemony led by the Doomsday Origin member.§!\n\nYou can alter spwaning rate BOTH by choosing Colonial Policies in said tab and/or by editing it in the Main Settings!"
