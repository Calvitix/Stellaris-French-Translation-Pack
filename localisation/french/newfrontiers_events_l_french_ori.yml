 newfrontiers_colony_event.1.name:0 "Ancient Machine"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.1.desc:0 "A research team on [Root.GetName] discovered a strange structure deep in the ice of the planet. It appears to be some kind of ancient machine, probably built by a civilization that inhabited the planet several thousand years ago. Preliminary investigations by our scientists indicate that the machine is an unusual terraforming device. Apparently, the ancient builders of this machine wanted to use it to transform the planet from a cold and gloomy world into a blooming garden. This ancient device is designed to generate a powerful beam aimed into the depths of the near gas giant. Our scientists believe this was intended to force it to emit a variety of gasses that would then be captured by [Root.GetName]'s gravitational pull, ultimately causing a greenhouse effect. It is not clear whether the ancients ever used the machine or simply abandoned the project.\n\nThe machine has been perfectly preserved and our scientists have no doubt that they can start it if necessary. Alternatively, we can just take it apart and study the technology of the former architects in more detail."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.2.name:0 "Ancient Machine Disassembled"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.2.desc:0 "Our scientists completed the disassembly of the ancient terraforming machine on [Root.GetName].

We will learn valuable ancient knowledge when we study it properly."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.3.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired its powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant did not react as expected. Our physicists say that the beam initiated thermonuclear fusion deep inside the gas giant! It looks like the machine really works, albeit in an unexpected way. The temperature on [Root.GetName] is rising steadily, and its glaciers are beginning to melt."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.4.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired its powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant did not react as expected. Our physicists say that the beam initiated thermonuclear fusion deep inside the gas giant! It looks like the machine really works, albeit in an unexpected way. The climate on [Root.GetName] is improving beyond our wildest expectations."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.5.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired its powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant did not react as expected. Unfortunately the gas giant emitted far more gas than our projections indicated, blocking the starlight and plunging [Root.GetName] into a deep freeze. Few managed to escape as [Root.GetName] turned into a barren frozen world in a matter of days."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.6.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired its powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant did not react as expected. Our physicists say that the beam initiated thermonuclear fusion deep inside the gas giant! Glaciers began to melt rapidly, but the shifting weight of the rising oceans destabilized [Root.GetName]'s tectonic plates. Magma unleashed from the planet's core and reacted with its oceans on an apocalyptic scale, literally tearing the planet's crust apart. This happened in just a few hours, and no one had time to escape."

 newfrontiers_colony_event.11.desc:0 "Communication with the colony on [Root.GetName] has been lost. According to a research team quickly sent to investigate, all of its population has inexplicably disappeared. The infrastructure of the settlement remains intact, but there is no sign of the missing colonists."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.12.a:0 "Very disturbing."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.12.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Another Long Night"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.12.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] has again fallen into darkness following another dip in its star's intensity. Remembering the disappearances during the last period of darkness, residents have prepared themselves for the worst. A special communications bunker has been established to maintain constant contact with the central government, recording and relaying everything that happens on [Root.GetName]. If something is wrong, we will find out."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.12.a:0 "We will be vigilant!"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.13.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Colony Attacked!"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.13.desc:0 "Attention! We received an urgent message that a major settlement on [Root.GetName] was attacked by unknown creatures. These monstrous creatures live in a hidden network of caves beneath the surface of the planet. Apparently they do not like sunlight, and come to the surface only under cover of night. Hordes of these terrible monsters have attacked our colony. We must take action immediately."

 newfrontiers_action.1.name:0 "[From.GetName]: Life in Hell"
 newfrontiers_action.1.desc:0 "An extensive network of giant cavities connected by tunnels has been discovered on the planet [From.GetName]. The most interesting thing is that it looks like a habitable atmosphere is somehow preserved under the surface of this molten world. Amidst lava falls and flaming underground rivers, in extreme conditions, a unique biosphere develops. This place can be populated."
 newfrontiers_action.3.name:0 "[From.GetName]: Life under the Ice"
 newfrontiers_action.3.desc:0 "An extensive network of giant ice caves connected by tunnels has been discovered on the planet [From.GetName]. Under the ice shell of this seemingly dead world are huge cavities with a breathable nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. These caves are essentially the air pockets of the ocean that surrounds the entire planet. Despite the lack of light, the bowels of the planet warm up the ocean, creating favorable conditions for the developed biosphere of this strange world. This place can be populated."
 newfrontiers_action.4.desc:0 "§Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! has a high pressure and atmosphere that is toxic to most life forms. Nevertheless, a thriving biocenosis has developed here, using ammonia instead of water as a solvent. The development of life has followed an ecological model that is significantly different from those that we know. Its study will significantly expand our knowledge in xenobiology."

At some point, this organism mutated, acquired a collective intelligence and, probably, destroyed its creators. After that it began to spread itself in the universe.\nAttaking the worlds, megamycelium forms a pathogen that resembles a mold, consisting of colonies of carnivorous microorganisms. These colonies grow on organic or solid nutrient substrates. The exofungus completely assimilates any material, rebuilds it for Thus, megamycelium completely rebuilds the worlds until it depletes them.\nBased on the data obtained, we were able to identify a number of measures to limit the spread of exofungi and even completely destroy spores. and we will investigate further."
