 newfrontiers_colony_event.1.name:0 "Ancient Machine"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.1.desc:0 "A research team at [Root.GetName] discovered a strange structure deep in the ice of the planet. It appears to be some kind of ancient machine, probably built by a civilization that inhabiting the planet several thousand years ago. Preliminary investigations by our scientists show with confidence that the machine is an unusual terraforming device. Apparently, the ancient builders of this machine wanted to use it to transform the planet from a cold and gloomy world into a blooming garden. The approach on terraforming of the machine is interesting. This ancient device is designed to generate a powerful beam, causing disturbances in the depths of the near gas giant. Our scientists believe this was intended to force it to emit a variety of gasses that would then be captured by [Root.GetName]'s gravitational pull, ultimately causing a greenhouse effect. It is not clear whether the ancients ever used the machine or instead abandoned the project.\n\nFor many thousands of years, the machine has been perfectly preserved and our scientists have no doubt that they can start it if necessary. Alternatively, we can just take it apart and study the technology of the former architects in more detail."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.2.name:0 "Ancient Machine Disassembled"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.2.desc:0 "Our scientists completed the disassemblence of the ancient terraforming machine on [Root.GetName]. We will never know whether the machine would have work or not, but our scientists report it was striking in its technological perfection. We will learn a lot about the knowledge of the ancients when we study it properly."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.3.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired it's powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant began to react rapidly. Our physicists say that the beam ignited thermonuclear fusion deep inside the gas giant. It looks like the machine really works, albeit in an unexpected way. The temperature on [Root.GetName] is rising evenly, and and it's glaciers are beginning to melt."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.4.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated.

Few managed to escape as [Root.GetName] turned into a barren frozen world in a matter of days."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.6.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired it's powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant began to react rapidly.

Preliminary investigations by our scientists show with confidence that the machine is an unusual terraforming device. Apparently, the ancient builders of this machine wanted to use it to transform the planet from a cold and gloomy world into a blooming garden. The operating principle of the machine is interesting. This ancient device is designed to generate a powerful beam, causing disturbances in the depths of the gas giant around which [Root.GetName] revolves. Our scientists believe this was intended to force the gas giant to emit a variety of gasses that would then be captured by [Root.GetName], causing a greenhouse effect. It is not clear whether the ancient race ever used the machine or instead abandoned the project.\n\nFor many thousands of years, the machine has been perfectly preserved and our scientists have no doubt that they can start it if necessary.

 newfrontiers_periodic_event.34.desc:0 "Global warming on the planet [Root.GetName] has finally come to an end. The face of the planet has changed beyond recognition. A new life begins to fill this once frozen world. The planet is waking up."
 
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.36.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: meteor shower"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.36.desc:0 "The planet [Root.GetName] entered a stream of large meteorites caused by the activity of other active celestial bodies such as comets and planetesimals, which, in turn, were affected by the gravitational interaction of large celestial bodies. Now the planet is regularly bombarded by large meteorites that do not burn in the atmosphere. The planet will not soon come out of a dangerous area of space and the surface may be subject to damage for months."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.38.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Incessant Thunderstorms"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.38.desc:0 "On the planet [Root.GetName], a season of severe storms and thunderstorms has begun. Monstrous cyclones form in the atmosphere, which cover entire continents and create zones of active convection. In these zones, a huge number of short-period electric discharges are formed, which move on the planet with a wide front and destroy everything in its path."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.40.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Terrible Hurricanes"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.40.desc:0 "On the planet [Root.GetName], the season for the formation of convergent cyclones and anticyclones has begun. This event is marked by the formation of cyclones and anticyclones in areas with low and high temperatures, which then begin to actively collide. This event generates violent storms and many atmospheric vortices in convergence zones. Many deadly tornadoes sweep across the surface of the planet."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.42.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Heavy Blizzards"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.42.desc:0 "On the planet [Root.GetName], the global sandstorm season has begun. During this period, foci of sandstorms form on the planet, which can reach sizes of several thousand kilometers in diameter. In the areas covered by such a storm, few can survive."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.44.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Heavy Sandstorms"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.44.desc:0 "On the planet [Root.GetName], the global snowstorm season has begun. When the season of strong winds comes, they raise a huge amount of tons of snow into the atmosphere. A colossal snow cover covers the entire planet making it difficult for the sun to enter. The temperature difference further enhances the activity of snow cyclones and the planet remains in a snow captivity for a long time."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.46.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Prolonged Drought"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.46.desc:0 "On the planet [Root.GetName], a season of long drought has begun. A hot climate has always been the norm on this planet, but even the most hardy ones are unable to survive during periods of intense solar activity. Almost all water bodies dry out, the air becomes suffocating, and the soil is covered with a hot crust."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.48.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Coriolis Storm"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.48.desc:0 "On the planet [Root.GetName], the season of the formation of strong Coriolis storms began. In the season of solar activity, a strong temperature difference occurs between the day and night side of the planet. As a result, a strong pressure drop occurs in the equatorial regions, which constantly shifts towards the terminator. A hurricane wind occurs in the drop zone, which is greatly enhanced by the rotation of the planet. A large number of plains does not create obstacles to the constant acceleration of the Coriolis storm. A hurricane wind passes through a wide front across the entire surface of the planet and can reach 700 km / h, sweeping away everything in its path."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.50.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Geomagnetic Storm"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.50.desc:0 "On the planet [Root.GetName], a season of constant geomagnetic storms has begun. The planet entered the zone of intense solar wind, which creates large disturbances in the geomagnetic field of the planet. The interaction of ionized particles occurs over almost the entire surface of the planet’s magnetosphere. This causes malfunctioning of all electromagnetic devices and inevitably leads to a drop in the production capacity of the planet."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.52.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Ion Storm"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.52.desc:0 "On the planet [Root.GetName], the season of ion storms has begun. The weakening of the planet’s magnetosphere leads to ionization of the upper atmosphere and provokes the emergence of monstrous and destructive storms. These storms create a background of electrical discharges that inflict huge damage in the affected area. The zones of ionic storms turn into lifeless wastelands."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.54.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Wild Hunt"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.54.desc:0 "On the planet [Root.GetName], the season of activity of local predators has begun. During this period, animals become especially aggressive and unite in flocks that attack the settlements."

 newfrontiers_periodic_event.58.desc:0 "On the planet [Root.GetName], the season of activity of aquatic predators has begun. During this period, many monsters appear from the depths of the oceans that terrorize marine settlements."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.60.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Sea Monsters"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.60.desc:0 "We recorded the appearance of many colossal creatures in the oceans of the planet [Root.GetName]. These leviathans were probably hibernated on the seabed. Most likely our activity on the planet woke them up. Now the worried giants are sweeping away everything in their path."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.62.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Tremor Earth"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.62.desc:0 "We recorded the appearance of many colossal creatures from beneath the surface of the planet [Root.GetName]. These leviathans were probably hibernated in underground tunnels. Most likely our activity on the planet woke them up. Now the worried giants are sweeping away everything in their path."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.64.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Huge Beasts"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.64.desc:0 "We recorded the appearance of many colossal creatures in the forests of the planet [Root.GetName]. These leviathans were probably hibernated in remote regions and caves. Most likely our activity on the planet woke them up. Now the worried giants are sweeping away everything in their path."
