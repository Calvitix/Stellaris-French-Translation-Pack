 apsr_sao.2.title:0 "«Aincrad» Project"
 apsr_sao.2.desc:0 "$RULER$, after our recent shielding of planet §H[From.GetName]§!, lead scientist [event_target:apsr_sao_societyleader.GetName] has proposed an experiment of unprecedented scale, which will encompass the entire planet.\nAccording to the project abstract, we'll need to develop advanced augmented reality technology, through which all of the planet's inhabitants will be forced to live in a semi-simulated world. Death in the world of the game will mean death in the real world as well.\nBesides the will to survive, players will also be motivated by our promise to, on the completion of the game's final level, remove the shield cutting off their planet from the rest of the galaxy, and to grant full freedom to the world's inhabitants. That is, to those who survive, at least."

 apsr_sao.3.desc:0 "$RULER$, we have successfully finished our preparations for the launch of project «Aincrad». Next time our colossus shields an inhabited planet, the project will be activated. All inhabitants will be drawn into a cruel and dangerous game, where their life and their future will be at stake."

 apsr_sao.92.desc:0 "Even though we've shielded planet §H[From.GetName]§!, project «Aincrad» cannot be launched, as a gestalt consciousness species is not an appropriate subject for this experiment.\nWe should find another planet."

 apsr_sao.93.desc:0 "Despite the fact that we screened planet §H[From.GetName]§!, the launch of the «Aincrad» project is impossible, since this type of planet cannot ensure the stable work of the research team.\nWe need to find another planet."
 apsr_sao.93.button:0 "Clear"
 apsr_sao.93.button.tooltip:0 "To start the project «Aincrad» we require a planet of the standart type. Planets of special and modified types that are not part of the base galaxy cannot be used as staging for the project.\n\n§MNote - only standard types of planets are suitable, such as continental, desert, ideal worlds and others. Types of planets that are added by modifications will not work.§!"

But what would you say if I told you that, in fact, there is no field around your planet at all, that everything you see and feel is a deception - a product of an augmented reality simulation?

The only way out - is to get to the end of the game and defeat the final boss. Then you will return to the real world. But one final important point: if you die in this game, you will die in the real world as well. Good luck!»\nAfter these words, the being disintegrated into streams of the dark red liquid, which retreated back into the sea of hexagons in the planet's shield.

 apsr_sao.12.desc:0 "After the disappearance of the unknown being, the panic which had ceased upon his appearance reignited once more, with renewed strength. The unlucky inhabitants of the game were not simply afraid - they were horrified. The fact that their lives were now a lie shocked even the most stoic of them. It's unknown what awaits us in the future.\n\nHere the record ends."
 apsr_sao.12.button:0 "Rather interesting."
 apsr_sao.12.button.tooltip:0 "Now, the fate of §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§! is in the hands of its people"

 apsr_sao.13.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.13.desc:0 "In the year past since the beginning of the experiment, the population of the planet has decreased by 20%. Causes of death range from encounters with monsters created by the game, to suicide and even murder.\nNow on planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§! everything has more or less settled down, and the unwilling players have started to play through the game, in hopes of making it to the end."
 apsr_sao.13.button:0 "Keep me in the loop"
 
 # 2-3 years from begin (5-7)
 apsr_sao.14.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.14.desc:0 "$RULER$, news from planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§!.\nThe game's players have cleared level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count] out of the total 100. Progressing so quickly has its cost - the death toll may climb even further yet."
 apsr_sao.14.button:0 "Let's see what they're made of"
 
 # 3-5 years from begin (8-12)
 apsr_sao.15.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.15.desc:0 "$RULER$, more news from planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§!.\nLevel [Root.apsr_sao_level_count] has been cleared. The inhabitants of the planet are uniting into groups and organizing joint operations so as to minimize risk and losses. For now, their level of organization is rather weak, but there's some potential here.\nWe can expect an acceleration in their rate of level clearing, and a reduction of casualties."
 apsr_sao.15.button:0 "Interesting"
 
 # 4-7 years from begin (13-22)
 apsr_sao.16.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.16.desc:0 "The inhabitants' organization efforts on planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§! have borne fruit. Just moments ago, they managed to clear level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count]. If all continues according to this trajectory, then it seems they may well make it to the end of the game within the next few decades."
 apsr_sao.16.button:0 "Bravo"

 apsr_sao.17.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.17.desc:0 "$RULER$, we've received news from planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§!.\nPlayers are continuing to make headway in clearing the game. Already they've passed level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count]. But just since the launch of the experiment, the adult population of the planet has decreased by 40%. If things continue at this pace, the people of planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§! will likely have some serious problems."
 apsr_sao.17.button:0 "Continue to observe"
 
 # 6-11 years from begin (23-39)
 apsr_sao.18.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.18.desc:0 "$RULER$, bad news. Lead scientist [event_target:apsr_sao_societyleader.GetName] has decided to link into the game.\nWhen this became known to us, it was already too late. His ship managed to create a small breach in the planetary shield and penetrate within. Moreover, he's disguised himself and we cannot find him.\nIn other news, the people of planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§! have cleared level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count]."

 apsr_sao.19.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.19.desc:0 "On planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§! the experiment continues. The speed of progress through the game is gradually decreasing. This could have to do with the decreased number of people particpating - whether from death, or the fear of death. At this point, level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count] has been cleared."
 apsr_sao.19.button:0 "Continue to observe"
 
 # 8-15 years from begin (31-51)
 apsr_sao.20.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.20.desc:0 "$RULER$, news from planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§!.\nEnough time has passed now since the beginning of the experiment that, even though the adult population of the planet has been cut in half, the next generation has come to replace them. Perhaps by the time the game is finished, the new generation will have entirely replaced the old. Level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count] has been cleared."
 apsr_sao.20.button:0 "Interesting"
 
 # 9-17 years from begin (34-57)
 apsr_sao.21.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.21.desc:0 "$RULER$, more news from planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§!.\nThe speed of progress through the game continues to fall. More and more of the youth are arriving to replace the older generation, but despite the inflow of forces for battle, organization is getting worse and worse. At the same time, a new guild has appeared on the planet, «The Knights of the Blood Oath», who are using their years of experience to plan raids. With their help, level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count] was successfully cleared."

 # 10-19 years from begin (39-64)
 apsr_sao.22.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.22.desc:0 "$RULER$, we have news from planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§!.\n«The Knights of the Blood Oath» has managed to take on a large number of supports in recent times, thanks to its unique approach to raid organization, which has resulted in low death rates, and as well to its charismatic commander, a natural-born leader. It's possible that this turn of events will hasten the game's completion, as they've already managed to clear level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count]."
 apsr_sao.22.button:0 "Collect more information"

 apsr_sao.23.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.23.desc:0 "$RULER$, news from planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§!.\n«The Knights of the Blood Oath» continue to clear levels, bringing down casualty numbers practically to zero. Level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count] has already been cleared! Our scientists express concern that we may not have sufficiently balanced the difficulty of the levels. In any case, changing anything at this point isn't recommended, so as to avoid inconsistencies and data desynchronization."

The speed of progress is amazing - a few days ago level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count] was cleared. The guild leader continues to personally lead level-clearing efforts and in every possible way tries to convince people to continue the fight."
 apsr_sao.24.button:0 "The experiment is nearing its completion"

 apsr_sao.25.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.25.desc:0 "$RULER$, yet more news from planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§!.\nProgress through the game has decreased somewhat - level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count] has only just been cleared. Despite the charisma of the leader of «The Knights of the Blood Oath», people are growing tired of fighting, of the fear of death, and want to simply live in peace. Our specialists predict the inevitable collapse of the guild. If only the game could be finished before that time comes."
 apsr_sao.25.button:0 "Continue to observe"
 
 # 14-27 years from begin (62-95)
 apsr_sao.26.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.26.desc:0 "$RULER$, news from planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§!.\nPeople are leaving «The Knights of the Blood Oath». Meanwhile, the young generation is refusing to risk their lives in order to finish some kind of mysterious game, as they no longer believe they're in a simulation. They believe that their life and the world around them, the only one they can remember, is reality. Our scientists are already studying this phenomenon.\nDespite these problems, «The Knights of the Blood Oath» continue to progress through the game. Their current location is level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count]."

 apsr_sao.27.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.27.desc:0 "$RULER$, news from planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§!.\nThe number of players participating in clearing the game is rapidly falling. «The Knights of the Blood Oath» are clearly starting to lose ground. And although their influence is still considerable, the imminent collapse of the organization and an abrupt fall of the speed of level clearing is obvious to all. Nonetheless, just days ago level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count] was cleared. It's unknown, though, if the guild will have sufficient strength to reach the end."
 apsr_sao.27.button:0 "The end is nigh"

 apsr_sao.28.title:0 "$apsr_sao.2.title$"
 apsr_sao.28.desc:0 "$RULER$, more news from planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§!.\n«The Knights of the Blood Oath» continue their slow progression through the game. Despite their problems, they have managed to best level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count]. But it is clear that the guild is already stretched to its limits. We expect its collapse within 2-3 years, as many skilled fighters have already left, and the enlistment of young warriors is extremely low."

 apsr_sao.29.desc:0 "$RULER$, urgent news from planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§!.\nWe found our scientist that vanished all those years ago! More precisely, he was found by one of the citizens of planet §H[event_target:apsr_sao_planetname.GetName]§!. It turns out that the scientist, using his knowledge about project «Aincrad», was able to quickly rise through the ranks of the game and become one of its most influential players. Even you, $RULER$, have surely heard of him. He was none other than the leader of «The Knights of the Blood Oath»! It's due to his knowledge of the game they were able to so rapidly progress through the levels with such few losses. Unfortunately, after he was identified, the players were convinced he was the final boss and killed him, and the absence of any sort of reaction from the game has discouraged them from any desire to continue trying. It seems that level [Root.apsr_sao_level_count] won't be cleared after all..."

But their effectiveness falls every day and with every casualty. Nobody wants to risk their life anymore. Reinforcements of new fighters no longer arrive, quite the opposite - experienced warriors are abandoning the fight and going to live out their days in peace and quiet.
