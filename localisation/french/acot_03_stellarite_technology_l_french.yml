While the concept sounds weird and quite dumb, it may be possible to instead turn the entire cannon into a powerful warphole generator that can tear a fabric of space and sends the warhead inside enemy ship, bypassing shields and travelling distance completely. The only issue as of now, is how to do that while still maintaining the speed and velocity of the projectile?"
