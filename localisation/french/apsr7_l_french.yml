And when it was filled with the overflowing time energy, it spits it into the surrounding environment. \nAccording to the extant documents found nearby, the time is meant as a physical process. Scientists of the civilization the pendulum was created by had developed a theory that the time can be used as a physical process connected with energy. This theory is based on considering time a material process that produces some type of energy. Later, the numerical characteristics determining the release of the time energy were defined - first theoretically, then practically.
