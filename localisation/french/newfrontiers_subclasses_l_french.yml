 panthalassic_world:0 "Panthalassic World"
 panthalassic_world_desc:0 "This ocean world is completely devoid of land. The entire surface of the planet is one enormous, constantly moving ocean. Construction of buildings on this planet is possible only on the ocean bed or on specially built floating platforms.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 poisonous_world:0 "Poisonous World"
 poisonous_world_desc:0 "This humid world is covered with dense tropical jungle and swampy plains teeming with poisonous plants and animals. Once this world was a blossoming tropical paradise, where biological diversity reached incredible heights, and not a single mass extinction occurred over many millions of years. As a result, the complete absence of differences in ecosystems led to species competition. The struggle for survival has led evolution along the path of development of toxic secretions as a means of protection and hunting. Virtually all animals of the planet, without exception, are capable of killing one of hundreds of thousands of species of poisons and are not suitable for food due to the high risk of poisoning.\n\nType: §Mexotic§!"
 swamp_world:0 "Swamp World"
 swamp_world_desc:0 "This is a world of murky swamps, poisonous fumes, and coal forests. There are almost no open bodies of water on the planet, but there is some hydrosphere consisting of endless swamps and flooded jungles with small muddy islets. Thanks to these conditions, this world is an excellent source of various organic gases.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 karstic_world:0 "Karst World"
 karstic_world_desc:0 "This planet was once an oceanic world, but as a result of changes in the activity of the star the oceans slowly evaporated, exposing the surface covered with deep scars and cavities. Now, the entire planet is covered by giant canyons and a huge network of caves, which greatly facilitate access to mineral resources. On the flip side, the presence of such a huge number of hidden formations will attract many pirate and terrorist groups.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 glacial_world:0 "Glacial World"
 glacial_world_desc:0 "Much of the surface of this planet is covered in a huge ice shell. An incredible frost reigns in this world, and deadly snowstorms prevent the development of more than a meager biosphere. The almost lifeless landscape consists of ice rocks and occasionally weathered cliffs, opening access to rare minerals under the surface of the planet.\n\nType: §Rextreme§!"
 dune_world:0 "Dune World"
 dune_world_desc:0 "This planet consists of an endless sea of dunes interrupted only by rare mountain ranges. In this world of desert, there are no open sources of water. Small water sources can only be found at the cooler polar caps or deep underground. Frequent sandstorms regularly grind down what is on the surface.\n\nType: §Rextreme§!"
 boreal_world:0 "Boreal World"
 boreal_world_desc:0 "Not so long ago (by cosmic standards), this planet survived the ice age. Now its glaciers are retreating, baring the earth that was previously covered in ice. Wild rivers and geothermal zones hidden in the depths of the moving glaciers will serve as an excellent source of energy. The low temperature and frozen lands are, however, harsh. Coniferous plants dominate its surface landscape, competing with different mosses and lichens.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 underground_world:0 "Underground World"
 underground_world_desc:0 "The incredibly huge caves and tunnels under the surface of this world probably originated from the active hydrosphere which once occupied a significant part of this planet. Raging streams of hot water created a giant underground network due to a sudden overheating of the surface. Now, underneath the earth, there is a hidden world characterized by a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a developing biosphere.\n\nType: §Rextreme§!\n\n------------ \n\n§WNot possible to terraform§! \n\n§WNot possible to bombard§!"

 tempest_world:0 "Tempest World"
 tempest_world_desc:0 "This is a world of paradox, cooled by the heat of the local star. In fact, this is a common phenomenon in which the gravitational position of the planet in relation to its parent star in the solar system causes the atmosphere to be in constant motion. The unceasing winds increase heat exchange and cool what rests on the surface. This is a very harsh planet, whose landscape is polished by storms. Animal and plant life is extremely sparse and exists only in caves and shelters.\n\nType: §Rextreme§!"
 geothermal_world:0 "Geothermal World"
 geothermal_world_desc:0 "This world would be another frozen ball in infinite space, but the incredible activity of the planet’s geosphere has done its job.

 dust_world:0 "Dust World"
 dust_world_desc:0 "This extremely arid world has undergone severe degredation of the soil due to continuous, uncontrolled erosion. Mighty winds occasionally raise huge dust storms that rage across the planetary surface, plunging the sky into a perpetual rusty twilight, over the centuries grinding down the mountain ranges. \n\nType: §Rextreme§!"
 oasis_world:0 "Oasis World"
 oasis_world_desc:0 "This desert paradise is dominated by a single ocean, which occupies 15% of the surface. The rest of the planet is covered by extensive desert biomes hidden mostly in rain shadow. Vegegation concentrates on the coast of this great body of water, which has over time reached some distance into the desert interior.\n\nType: §Gparadise§!"
 salt_world:0 "Salt World"
 salt_world_desc:0 "Once dominated by large, cool oceans, this world had both a humid climate and rich biosphere. Then an unknown cataclysm, possibly related to changes in the activity of its home star, caused the oceans to suddenly evaporate. Half the surface is covered with endless salt flats suitable for only extremophile organisms. The little liquid remaining is now concentrated into extremely salty brine seas. \n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 steppe_world:0 "Steppe World"
 steppe_world_desc:0 "The geological activity of this very old world ceased long ago, with long-term erosion causing former mountain ranges to essentially vanish over the eons. The entire surface is now covered by endless grassy meadows, fertile prairies, and windblown steppes.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 snow_world:0 "Snow World"
 snow_world_desc:0 "This arctic world has a saturated hydrosphere. Its main form of precipitation is heavy snowfall at all latitudes, with blizzards occuring frequently across the surface. Despite or maybe because of this, the planet is considered aesthetically pleasing, and is regarded as particularly suitable for certain recreational activities.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 melting_world:0 "Melting World"
 melting_world_desc:0 "This continental world once had oceans completely covered by ice shelves.

 pangea_world:0 "Pangea World"
 pangea_world_desc:0 "The tectonic plates and continental masses of this world have currently formed one supercontinent. Although the coastal regions are a thriving paradise, the continental zones, far from the fertile river valleys near the coast, consist mainly of dry steppe and sun-scorched arid biomes stretching over thousands of kilometers. Violent weather and hurricanes force winds deep in the main lands and are deadly to the unprepared visitor.\n\nType: §Rextreme§!"
 atoll_world:0 "Atoll World"
 atoll_world_desc:0 "While tectonics did not allow the formation of large landmasses on this world, it was nonetheless covered in massive undersea volcanoes constantly forming smaller islands. Over the eons, many of these volcanic islands eroded and were covered by the ocean becoming home to megacorals. The megacorals form the distinctive giant atolls of this tropical paradise. Distributed almost evenly from pole to pole, the giant coral islands of this world are a true masterpiece of natural creation.\n\nType: §Gparadise§!"
 algic_seas:0 "Algic Seas"
 algic_seas_desc:0 "A world of great beauty, this planet is covered in supercolonies of algae that migrate across the oceans, painting them in vivid red and green hues. Substances excreted from some species have unique healing properties that can be put to great medical use.\n\nType: §Mexotic§!"
 monsoon_world:0 "Monsoon World"
 monsoon_world_desc:0 "Orbital and geographic features of this world lead to sudden changes in wind direction over its seasons. Rapid heating of the land in summer causes large-scale flooding from inward-moving monsoon rains, while the winters are fairly dry as the air returns to the sea. This world would be almost ideal for habitation if not for the numerous large hurricanes that form in late summer as the oceans warm.\n\nType: §Rextreme§!"
 ancient_world:0 "Ancient World"
 ancient_world_desc:0 "Many millenia ago, this world was the cradle of some forgotten precursor civilization, their identity remaining a mystery to this day.

 jungle_world:0 "Jungle World"
 jungle_world_desc:0 "Stuffy, dense jungle covers the entire surface of this rocky planet. The rich flora of this world shows incredible tenacity and growth rate, in attempts to take possession of any free area of space. In the conditions of such an aggressive spread of local vegetation, cultivation of land for agriculture seems to be a very difficult task.\n\nType: §Bnormal§!"
 coriolis_world:0 "Coriolis World"
 coriolis_world_desc:0 "Due to the high speed of rotation of the planet, this world is subject to strong, incessant winds that always blow in the same direction. Closer to the equator, the speed of air currents increases. Friction of air against rocks in these areas creates the effect of intense heating of the surface and atmosphere. Many life forms on this planet have adapted to the harsh conditions of the windy wasteland. The fauna and flora of the planet exist in a closed cycle of constantly moving air masses in the vicinity of extended equatorial water bodies.\n\nType: §Rextreme§!"
 mineral_world:0 "Mineral World"
 mineral_world_desc:0 "A huge amount of various minerals is concentrated in the crust of this planet. The active movement of tectonic plates forms mountain massifs from ore-rich rock formations with a predominantly crystalline structure.

And on some wretched pieces of land, a unique life has even survived, which was able to adapt to monstrous conditions.\n\nType: §Rextreme§!"
 ash_world:0 "Ash World"
 ash_world_desc:0 "This rocky world is going through an acute phase of a global volcanic winter. Active tectonic processes on the planet have stopped, but the atmosphere is heavily polluted with ash and sulfurous gases. The dense cover of volcanic emissions has led to an anti-greenhouse effect, and sunlight hardly reaches the surface.\n\nType: §Rextreme§!"

 
 sulfur_world:0 "Sulfur World"
 sulfur_world_desc:0 "This is a molten and constantly geologically active world, the main parts of which consists of various silicate rocks and sulfur compounds. The volcanism on this world contributes to frequent changes in the atmosphere. Due to sulfur compounds ejected by volcanic eruptions, this world from orbit is characterized by its various shades of yellow, white, red, black and green. This world's little gravitation pulls only some magma down on the planet's surface. While a fraction falls back on the planet in the form of molten sulfur rain, some is ejected directly into space, set out on an endless journey beyond the planets atmosphere."
 greenhouse_world:0 "Greenhouse World"
 greenhouse_world_desc:0 "This is a world on which time has played a cruel joke. Sometime in the past, this world might have been inhabited, but as the star around which it rotated grew, the temperature of the world rose, causing liquid water to evaporate and releasing captured greenhouse gases from the crust. Over the millenia, the greenhouse effect turned the planet into a greenhouse world. It's atmosphere now is dominated by carbon dioxide, nitrogen and sulfur dioxide. The surface temperature forces whole mountains to melt, so the landscape of the planet constantly changes."
 methane_world:0 "Methane World"
 methane_world_desc:0 "The atmosphere of this gloomy world consists of nitrogen and methane-ethane compounds, which very often precipitate on the surface. Such vast lakes are formed."
