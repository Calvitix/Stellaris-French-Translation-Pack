 pc_SMCO_sub_brown_dwarf_star_desc:0 "Sub-brown dwarfs are celestial objects between brown dwarfs and gas giants in mass. While they form from the gravitational collapse of gas clouds, like other stars, their mass is below the limit necessary to have fusion reactions that would otherwise occur in stars. There has been much debate on whether such an object should be classified as a planet or as a star."

 pc_SMCO_bok_globule_desc:0 "Bok globules are dense nebulae whose inner regions could potentially form stars. Due to their densities, they can shield forming stars from stellar winds stripping them away, but also block the transmission of light through them."

 SMCO_rogue_event.5.b:0 "I was once an astronomer from an empire that probably now does not exist, tasked with exploring the stars in this galaxy. I have observed and analyzed countless stars and planets, appreciating each of them, but one that captured my attention the most were rogue planets. Seeing them drift across space, most of them without a companion to keep each other company, elicted a progressive sense of lonliness in me as I observed more and more of them, and in time, that sense of lonliness coalesced into a desire. \n\nA desire to give them the companionship that they once had."
 SMCO_rogue_event.5.c.name:0 "Access Message III"
 SMCO_rogue_event.5.c:0 "And so, I made my plans. I continued to map out the galaxy, making personal notes on the locations of rogue planets. After a while, I decided that I should first a few of these rogue planets orbit around their kin, as a test before moving on to make them orbit around stars that already have orbiting planets, so as to refine my methods discreetly. And in a way... I don't want my pursuits to potentially rob a planet enjoying the warmth of a nearby star of its company. It feels... selfish. \n\nThen, I waited until the empire can produce ships large and powerful enough to move planets, and managed to obtain one for myself. I picked out a large rogue planet to act as the 'star', and traveled to nearby rogue planets to move them towards it."
 SMCO_rogue_event.5.d.name:0 "Access Message IV"
 SMCO_rogue_event.5.d:0 "It was an arduous process, having to first slowly move the planets so as to not disturb whatever may be on it. Then, after I moved one of them to be near the designated 'star', I carefully adjusted and fine-tuned the planet's orbit so that it would not be unstable and either collide or move away from the 'star'. Yet, despite all the difficulties, I enjoyed it, especially when I got the first rogue planet to successfully orbit the 'star'. Seeing the both of them accompanying each other, after what could be millenia of floating in the galaxy alone, warmed my heart."

 SMCO_rogue_event.5.e:0 "I continued on with my desire, always imagining the joy and glee when the rogue planets finally get to meet up with another body, along with the stories and experiences the rogue planets would tell once they get close. But as I went to start moving the fourth rouge planet, old age has finally caught up with me, and I felt more and more lethargic every day. By the time I got the fourth rogue planet to be in a stable orbit, I knew my remaining time was short, so I recorded this message and set my ship on a course into the 'star', so I will always be accompanying them as they had with me. The thought of that is oddly soothing."
 SMCO_rogue_event.5.f.name:0 "Access Message VI"
