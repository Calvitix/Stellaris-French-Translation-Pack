This atrocity cannot be overlooked!\n\nAs the holy guardians of the one true faith, we demand you surrender your corrupted technologies at once, or we will bring divine punishment upon your misbegotten kind!."

[FallenEmpireTaskTarget.GetName], you have violated the established regulations regarding the use of dangerous technologies as per Codex GTX-3198 Page 133337-163641. §R"Under no circumstances are the class-5 technology empires permitted to make alterations to the Dark Matter-based technologies without our supervisions."§!.\n\nWe must now enforce the law and confiscate all of your technologies. Once we can verify the potentials and dangers, you will be permitted to retain any technologies we deemed appropriate. Resist and we will use lethal forces, the technological supremacy of [FallenEmpireTaskTarget.GetName] must  prevail."
acot_war_in_hell.1.desc.xenophile: "[FallenEmpireTaskTarget.GetName], you are attempting to use technologies that go beyond our safety regulations. We can see that you are going to use it for malicious ends. This we cannot allow. We [FallenEmpireTaskOrigin.GetName] are the guardians of this galaxy, and thus it falls to our duty to ensure that your wrongdoings cannot go unpunished.\n\nReturn those technologies to us, and we will not write you as a criminal harboring dangerous powers."
acot_war_in_hell.1.desc.xenophobe: "Fools, you think your foolish attempts to surpass us has not gone unnoticed!? We command and conquer you to hand us the techs that you recently acquired, and we will kill you. Refuse, and we will kill you. The choice is clear. You have no say in this matter."

acot_war_in_hell.1.b: "We have no time for this. Take these data and get out."
acot_war_in_hell.1.b.tooltip: "The Fallen Empire will awake and acquire all advanced technologies that they have somehow never managed to learn for over a million of years while we could do so in a span of a couple years. But at least they won't declare war on us right away."
acot_war_in_hell.1.b.response: "We shall see. Executor, prepare to confiscate all technologies and bring the technology cache aboard our homeworld for study."

acot_war_in_hell.1.d: "§Y(Lie)§! Our goal is to develop this new power for your use, great one."
acot_war_in_hell.1.d.tooltip: "We will pretend to give them the technologies, but little will they know that the cache inside is filled with a powerful precursor virus that will cause massive damage to precursor-based technologies. Most modern empires with proper science divisions should be able to easily detect and contain the virus, but given the incompetence and the lack of development of these old fools, chances are they will not be the wiser."
acot_war_in_hell.1.d.response: "Good. Learn to respect our authority and your empire may perhaps have a chance to survive for but a fraction of our reign.\n\nExecutor, prepare to confiscate all technologies and bring the technology cache aboard our homeworld for study. We begin preparations at once!"

acot_war_in_hell.200.desc.b: "An interesting development within the galactic climate has occurred. Apparently, someone must have made the [FallenEmpireTaskOrigin.GetName] very very angry, as they have decided to stop being dormant and have once again awakened to reclaim their lost glory."

acot_war_in_hell.16.desc: "Through sheer resolve and will, we have triumphed over our fallen enemies. We have shown the galaxy that the fallen empires are naught but a cob-web of lies.

acot_war_in_hell.17.desc: "See, you plebeians know nothing of warfare.

Your resources will be drained. Your fleets will be destroyed.\n\nConsider  yourselves lucky, our ancestors would have done much worse."

acot_war_in_hell.18.desc: "The device worked as planned. The Fallen Empire attempted to crack open the virus-imbued cache upon their capital planet. But the damage done by the virus appears to be much greater than we anticipated, it is as if their whole system just collapsed altogher!\n\nReports indicate the entire navy stationed aboard their homeworld has been destroyed along with the planet itself.
