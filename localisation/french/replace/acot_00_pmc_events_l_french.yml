Unfortunately, most of their components break down and self-destruct upon destruction of the ship, so we will not be able to directly analyze any of their ship's debris.\n\nHowever, we believe that if we can destroy enough of their ships, our researchers may yet be able to form a pattern and develop countermeasures around their encrypted systems, allowing us to develop new components using a combination of our own technologies and theirs."

With enough luck, we may be able to develop new technology by combining these fragments with our own Alpha components to even up the playing field.\n\nAlternatively, we can simply liquify these components into raw materials and insert their data into our combat computer's targeting systems, which will make it easier for us to damage their ships in battle for awhile."
