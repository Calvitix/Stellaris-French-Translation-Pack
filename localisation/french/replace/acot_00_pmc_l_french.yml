tech_precursor_phanon_design_pe_1_desc: "Despite the overwhelming scale and firepower displayed by the Phanon Corp's armada, it seems that many of their technologies are not that inherently arcane in their designs.

tech_precursor_phanon_design_pe_2_desc: "The extra fragments and debris recovered, coupled with the observed behaviors of the Phanon's weapon systems, allow us to make a more intensive analysis on their technologies. Obviously, we are still nowhere close to understanding the real power source, but we are confident that this will give us additional insight into how their ships operate."
