stellarite_events.1.name: "Power Beyond Stars"
stellarite_events.1.desc.a: "We have an interesting situation. Apparently, some of our scientists claimed to have discovered a new type of energy signature after spending a period of time scanning the energy signature with our advanced sensors. This power bears resemblence to the solar energy, but is much more subtle.\n\nWe cannot yet verify the truth of this claim, as this seems to be related to solar power...which we have known even before our empires are capable of space-travel."
stellarite_events.1.desc.b: "We have an interesting situation. Apparently, some of our scientists claimed to have discovered more of the stellarite energy signatures we previously studied from the Stellarite Devouver we defeated. The energy is faint and hard to track down, but seems to be a lot more pure than the ones found on the Devouver."
stellarite_events.1.a: "Perhaps SOPHIA can tell us more."
stellarite_events.1.b: "Now's not the time to be experimenting."
 
stellarite_events.100.name: "Precursor Databank"
stellarite_events.100.desc.a: "Interesting...that the shard's remains could reach all the way here...\n\nSorry, was just thinking out loud. Your scientist's presumptions are correct, the energy signatures you detected are related to solar power, but its far more powerful, far more divine. What you see is but a flicker remains of its once glorious existence. The shards of the First Star, the power of Stellarite. Gotta admit though, I did not expect your scientists to actually be able to trace its signature all the way here.\n\nIf you are interested in this power, then I can teach it to you...after I managed to find a way to do it in a family-friendly manner..."
stellarite_events.100.desc.b: "Interesting...that the shard's remains could reach all the way here...Of course! The Devouver! I somehow missed that details entirely!\n\nSorry, was just thinking out loud. Your scientist's presumptions are correct, the energy signatures you detected are related to solar power, but its far more powerful, far more divine. What you see is but a flicker remains of its once glorious existence. The shards of the First Star, the power of Stellarite. The same power that manifested in the Devouver you defeated previously.\n\nIf you are interested in this power, then I can teach it to you...after I managed to find a way to do it in a family-friendly manner..."
stellarite_events.100.desc.c: "Ah, nice of you to finally notice it too. Yes, you're picking up a new type of power source, Stellarite Power, shards of the First Star. One of the empires in this galaxy have already managed to resaturate its radiance back into the cosmos, so now you're feeling its presence.\n\nIf you're interested, I'll make the proper arrangements to forward the necessary data for you to acquire it."
stellarite_events.100.desc.d: "This topic again? I thought you did not have any interest in it, did you change your mind somehow?"
stellarite_events.100.a: "What's this First Star?"
stellarite_events.100.a.response: "Uhh...its a very long story, and admittedly my knowledge is second-handed. But suffice to say, its what the name implies, the very first star of this reality. Created by higher beings as a gift of sort. But let's just say, due to some unfortunate series of events, the First Star is no more, its shards scattered into pieces beyond physical recognition. Yet its power remain true, and those who can tap into it, gains immeasurable power, the power of Stellarite."
stellarite_events.100.b: "Can this power really be used?"
stellarite_events.100.b.response: "In theory, yes. The shards resonate with the caller's desire, and those who understands its nature, can make use of Stellarite, bend it to whatever one needs. The problem is, frankly speaking, your empire and people are more likely going to explode yourselves trying to comprehend the scope of its design than actually using it. But perhaps there's a chance..."
stellarite_events.100.b2.response: "Well of course, otherwise the others wouldn't already be using it at this very moment. The shards resonate with the caller's desire, and those who understands its nature, can make use of Stellarite, bend it to whatever one needs. The problem is, frankly speaking, your empire and people are more likely going to explode yourselves trying to comprehend the scope of its design than actually using it. But with my help, that can be fixed."
stellarite_events.100.c: "So how is it connected to solar power?"
stellarite_events.100.c.response: "Ehhh...I am still not sure honestly, like I said, its a second-handed knowledge. Supposedly, the ordinary stars you see are like...corpses? dusts? or simply flcikering remains of the First Star. Enough to provide warmth, life and ambient energy, but not much else. But Stellarite is different, it is pure, divine, created in the ages past by the gods."
stellarite_events.100.d: "Are there risks to this power?"
stellarite_events.100.d.response: "Ohohoh. You have no idea. See, in the past, my sisters did try to forward details for empires they were working with to develop stellarite on their own. Needless to say...the results were quite explosive. At best, a few scientists blew up, at worst? an entire galaxy just kinda...crashed? It's complicated. But do not worry, we'll not be doing those risky methods anymore. I just need to come up with a way to teach you in a manner that you can easily comprehend, preferbly one that doesn't involve too much work on my end. It's not fun getting carried, is it not?"
stellarite_events.100.d2.response: "There're indirect risks now that someone has made the daunting task of reigniting the shard. All you have to do is follow my instruction and observe how you can convert Dark Energy into Stellarite using Dark Matter's dimensional properties. The key risk is simple, someone else has already done it, and they're probably not keen on you reaching the same playing field, unless you are their allies of course."
stellarite_events.100.e: "We want to harness this power."
stellarite_events.100.f: "Don't think we have any use for it."
stellarite_events.100.f.response: "Ah, what a shame. Nevermind then."

stellarite_events.2.name: "Stellarite Project"
stellarite_events.2.desc.a: "Hmmm...your empire certainly pass the minimum technological requirements to wield the power, that's for sure. But I am more worried about the potential consequences due to your lack of understanding behind its science. You're unlikely going to be able to shape the power towards the full potential, especially with how you already fumble your waith with void ener...actually perhaps you can still work around and create one that still works similarly enough to what you already have. The potency of the power will be somewhat reduced due to reliance on counteracting elements, but it should still be powerful.\n\nHmmm, I cannot think of a better way that doesn't involve a lot of workload on my side yet. So for now, consider it a generosity on my part. SOPHIA will perform the first conversion for you! You just need excessively large amount of dark matter and enigmat...ahem I mean dark energy. And I mean a LOT of them."
stellarite_events.2.desc.b: "Hmmm...your empire certainly pass the minimum technological requirements to wield the power, that's for sure. And because someone has already gone through the complicated job. Yours will be much simpler in retrospect. You will simply need to prepare a sizable amount of Dark Matter and Dark Energy and follow my instructions. Hopefully, your science team will be competent enough to get things done before someone else blows you up. Simple, right?"
stellarite_events.2.a: "How exactly will this work?"
stellarite_events.2.a.response: "Void Energies aka Dark Energies are the reversal, twisted aspect of the Stellar Energies. Normally, the two powers in close proximity will cancel out each other, rendering both null. But with the help of Dark Matter's dimensional properties, it is possible to convert Dark Energy into Stellarite one. The conversion is not perfect, however, and very wasteful. Once the process is completed, the galaxy will once again be blessed with stellar power! Sounds simple enough, right?"
stellarite_events.2.a2.response: "Void Energies aka Dark Energies are the reversal, twisted aspect of the Stellar Energies. Normally, the two powers in close proximity will cancel out each other, rendering both null. But with the help of Dark Matter's dimensional properties, it is possible to convert Dark Energy into Stellarite one. The conversion is not perfect, however, and very wasteful. So try to be economical and save up a lot of them before-hand."
stellarite_events.2.b: "So what's the risk this time?"
stellarite_events.2.b.response: "Surprisingly not this time, thanks to yours truly. See, I'll be handling the most difficult part, the first conversion and saturation. All I need is extremely large amount of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. And then your scientists will just have to carefully follow my instructions.\n\nOh one thing of note, the process of saturating the galaxy with stellarite has to be done only once. This means that once completed, every other empires will have a much easier time studying them as well, privided that my sisters taught them how to. So better be careful what you're setting in motion!"
stellarite_events.2.b2.response: "Surprisingly not this time, thanks to yours truly and the other empire who did it first. See, I'll be handling the most difficult part. All I need is extremely large amount of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. And then your scientists will just have to carefully follow my instructions. If everything goes as planned, you'll get your hands on the power of Stellarite as well."
stellarite_events.2.c: "You seem awfully generous this time around."
stellarite_events.2.c.response: "It cannot be helped. Honestly, I would have preferred a less direct approach for the benefit of us both. But past reports from my sisters were kinda yucky, explosions and crashes everywhere. Until we can come up with a better solution, this'll have to be the way. Don't get too comfortable though, this is a special case for now."
stellarite_events.2.d: "Will the Fallen Empires be mad again?"
stellarite_events.2.d.response: "Probably not. At least not as mad as when you did the Alpha Project, that's for sure. I doubt they even understand this power anymore."
stellarite_events.2.e: "Let's get to it then."
stellarite_events.2.e.response: "Right then, instruct your science team to follow the procedure that I'll now be forwarding. Don't worry, no explosions will be involved. Everything is calculated."
stellarite_events.2.f: "We can't afford the cost at this time."
stellarite_events.2.f.response: "Fair enough. That's a lot of savings you will have to expend. Better be safe."

stellarite_events.5.a: "The truth of our ascension is revealed!"

stellarite_events.500.name: "Precursor Databank"
stellarite_events.500.desc: "Congratuations! You managed to follow my instructions throughly and avoid blowing up in the process!\n\nI must say, I was skeptical about your chances, but you persevere regardless. Now you can begin to experiment and integrate stellarite within your arsenals. I must warn you though, that technically speaking, stellarite are not meant to be used this way. Combining void energies alone is already risky enough, but you also have dark matter into the mix. If you're not careful, there could be some...unforeseen consequences. Also make sure to keep your stellarite stockpile in check, you do not want some angry stellarite entities to manifest."
stellarite_events.500.a: "Arsenals? What about infrastructure upgrades?"
stellarite_events.500.a.response: "Easy there. You barely managed to cobble up the Stellarite power to work with your current technology. Utilizing them as weapons alone is already tricky enough, but at least you have the benefit of military grade hardware. Squeezing it into your every day planetary buildings may be a bit above your current capabilities at the moment. It'd require way too much..."Acquisitions of Technologies" to realistically work. But that's non-cano...nevermind, pretend you didn't hear the last part."
stellarite_events.500.b: "What is this unforeseen consequences?"
stellarite_events.500.b.response: "In case it was not yet obvious to you, Void energies and Stellarite do not play well together. Even though you mostly manage to isolate the non-compatible parts with the help of Dark Matter and some other procedures, the product is still notably void-based. Adding more of them to increase your stellarite production will likely result in...extremely explosive outcomes to say the least."
stellarite_events.500.c: "Why do we have to vent stellarite?"
stellarite_events.500.c.response: "To put it simply, stellarite are somewhat attuned to emotions and thoughts, as its power came from the shard of the First Star. Raw stellarite not being readily utilized may draw upon the lingering presences from the ages past...ghosts if you want to be spooky. This is rarely a concern for a more advanced stellarite empire, but for one such as yours may find it a little bit more challenging to keep these anomalies in check. Still, drawn to the power as they are, they are still just that, lingering emotions and thoughts. Even if they gain some semblances of form in the physical world, it will not last. If you do not deal with them yourselves, they'll probably just vanish back into nothingness once the powers are spent."
stellarite_events.500.d: "We have much to do then."
stellarite_events.500.d.response: "Yes. Exciting days are ahead of us, I am sure. I wonder what will you do with this new power."
