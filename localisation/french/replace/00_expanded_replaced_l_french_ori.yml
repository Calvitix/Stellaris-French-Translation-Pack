# Anomaly Failures
anomaly_failure.1.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] ordered the [Root.GetName] to dispatch a probe to investigate the crater on [From.GetName]. Unfortunately, its braking thrusters failed and the probe proceeded to smash right into the wrecked ship at the center of the crater. The crew of the [Root.GetName] have begun an investigation into their remaining probes to prevent similar incidents in the future."
anomaly_failure.2.desc:0 "This asteroid is not native to the [From.solar_system.GetName] System. Rather, given its differing composition and highly eccentric orbit, the asteroid is likely to be a captured asteroid from another star system. It is still slightly irradiated from its passage through interstellar space, but is otherwise unremarkable."
anomaly_failure.5.desc:0 "While attempting to open the docking hatch we found on [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] accidentally caused a tremor inside the asteroid. Unfortunately, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has deduced that this likely led to the destruction of the asteroid's interior."
anomaly_failure.6.desc:0 "The investigation of the massive surface crater on asteroid [From.GetName] has yielded nothing of interest, outside of a minor mineral deposit. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has ordered the [Root.GetName] to discontinue the mission."
anomaly_failure.7.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] made a failed attempt to dock with the space station orbiting [From.GetName]. Unfortunately, the fragile station disintegrated as a result. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] begs forgiveness."
anomaly_failure.7.desc.mach:0 "The [Root.GetName] made a failed attempt to dock with the space station orbiting [From.GetName]. Unfortunately, the fragile station disintegrated as a result. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that an unfortunate software glitch concerning trajectory calculations was to blame."
anomaly_failure.8.desc:0 "The source of the life signs that were reported on asteroid [From.GetName], if indeed there ever was one, has not been found despite repeated scans by the [Root.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] believes that the original signal was the result of a sensor error, and has recalibrated the [Root.GetName]'s systems accordingly."
anomaly_failure.16.desc:0 "Despite a thorough investigation, the [Root.GetName] has still not been able to deduce what caused the massive impact crater on [From.GetName]: no trace of the original impactor could be found. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] apologizes for this failure."
anomaly_failure.16.desc.mach:0 "Despite a thorough investigation, the [Root.GetName] has still not been able to deduce what caused the massive impact crater on [From.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has logged the failure as due to insufficient residue remaining on the surface of the moon."
anomaly_failure.18.desc:0 "There WAS some sort of unidentified object in orbit around [From.GetName], but the [Root.GetName] accidentally collided with it when moving closer to investigate. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the object, regrettably, was destroyed in the collision."
anomaly_failure.21.desc:0 "The initial survey report, which mentioned life signs originating from the surface of [From.GetName], must have been mistaken, as nothing of the sort has been found by the [Root.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the [From.GetPlanetMoon] now appears to be completely devoid of life."
anomaly_failure.22.desc:0 "What was thought to have been a hidden orbital station above [From.GetName] has been identified as garbage ejected by the very Science Ship that conducted the initial survey of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] and the crew of the [Root.GetName] suggest that we forget about this embarrassing episode and move on."
anomaly_failure.400.desc:1 "For unclear reasons, the resident Science Officer, [Root.GetLeaderName], decided to take out a shuttle from the [Root.GetName] to personally investigate asteroid [From.GetName]. An explosion was detected shortly afterwards when the shuttle accidentally impacted the asteroid's surface.\n\nA Board of Inquiry later determined that the late scientist had not been trained to operate a class-D shuttlecraft."
anomaly_failure.404.desc:0 "Several dormant military-grade drones designed by some long lost civilization sit clustered together in a small crater on the far side of [From.GetName]. As the [Root.GetName] comes within range of their passive sensors, the drones power up in an effort to fulfill their ancient programming directive - defend the system from intruders at all costs."
anomaly_failure.405.desc:0 "Active scans from the [Root.GetName] briefly picked up several structures on the surface of [From.GetName], only to have the signal drowned out by jamming interference seconds later. Several pirate ships have darted out of a hidden hangar on the asteroid and are now approaching in attack formation!"
anomaly_failure.901.desc:0 "We are still trying to piece together the details, but for some reason it looks like Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] ordered the [Root.GetName] into the upper atmosphere of [From.GetName] to investigate a sensor anomaly. Once there the stress to the vessel's hull eventually became too great, and it was lost with all hands."
anomaly_failure.902.desc:0 "While conducting deep scans of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] suffered a reactor failure and became trapped inside the gas giant's gravity well. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] successfully oversaw the evacuation of the entire crew, but the ship itself was pulled into the planet's dense atmosphere never to be seen again."
anomaly_failure.903.desc:0 "While approaching [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] stumbled upon two unknown vessels hiding in the gas giant's sensor shadow. They appear to be smugglers partaking in some kind of clandestine meeting. As soon as they spotted our ship, the smuggler ships disconnected from each other and powered up their weapons. They seem intent on not leaving any witnesses!"
anomaly_failure.1400.desc:0 "During operations above [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] suffered a containment breach in its reactor core. The safety of the entire ship was put into jeopardy, but thanks to a valiant act of sacrifice by Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], the engine room was successfully purged of radiation. Unfortunately, the scientist received a lethal dose of radiation poisoning and could not be saved."
anomaly_failure.1400.desc.mach:0 "During operations above [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] suffered a containment breach in its reactor core. As the safety of the entire ship was put into jeopardy, the vessel's Science Officer made the logical conclusion to sacrifice itself in order to purge the engine room of radiation, based on pre-programmed casualty weighting. In the process, [Root.GetLeaderName] received a dose of radiation large enough to result in semiconductor ionization and silicon lattice displacement damage, rendering them permanently inoperable. The ship and remaining crew, however, were saved."
anomaly_failure.1401.desc:0 "While rerouting power to its main sensor array, the [Root.GetName] experienced a critical reactor failure above [From.GetName]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] perished in the resulting explosion, along with the rest of the crew."
anomaly_failure.1402.desc:0 "We are uncertain exactly how it happened, but somehow the Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] inadvertently triggered the self-destruct sequence on the [Root.GetName] while running a simulation related to [From.GetName] on the ship's onboard computer. All attempts to abort the sequence met with failure, and the entire crew was forced to evacuate before the ship was destroyed."
anomaly_failure.1403.desc:0 "Several pirate ships suddenly launch from where they had been hidden on the surface of [from.GetName]. It appears that the [Root.GetName] has stumbled upon a pirate anchorage, and the cutthroats are none too pleased at this intrusion!"
anomaly_failure.1404.desc:0 "The orbital space over [from.GetName] is apparently used as some sort of mating ground by a large and aggressive species of spacefaring creatures. Angry at being disturbed by the [Root.GetName] in the middle of their coupling, two of the creatures set off to deal with the unwelcome intruder."
anomaly_failure.1405.desc:0 "A small squadron of ancient combat drones appears to have been abandoned in orbit of [from.GetName] after some long forgotten battle. As the active sensors of the [Root.GetName] sweep over them, the drones power up and enter attack mode!"
anomaly_failure.2655.desc:0 "As the [Root.GetName] approaches [From.GetName], it is intercepted by a couple of less-than-friendly smuggling ships. The hostiles turn their weapons on the asteroid, destroying all evidence of whatever operation they were running there. The [Root.GetName] is next, it seems."


# Ancient Relics
ancient_battle_site_desc:0 "Scans of [From.Planet.GetName] have revealed an area packed with refined material and scattered radiologicals, although little is visible from orbit. To find out more we will need to investigate the site on the ground."
ancrel.4031.desc_sinkhole:1 "The crew clearing the sinkhole on [Root.GetName] has made a breathtaking discovery - buried deep within the chasm under multiple layers of liquids and tightly packed sediment $ancrel.4031.desc$"

diplomatic.2.name:0 "[From.GetAdj] Admiral Insults Us"
diplomatic.2.desc:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are well known to have few good things to say about alien lifeforms in general. Those who do diplomacy in the [From.GetName] cannot afford a short temper, as they can rarely expect anything beyond a bare minimum of respect, if that. However, while traversing [Root.GetAdj] space, communications usually stay within formal protocols.\n\nNot so earlier today, when [broadcasted_insult_leader.GetName] decided to unleash an utterly vitriolic message on our unsuspecting public while commandeering a fleet through the [broadcasted_insult_system.GetName] System. The admiral appears to have picked up radio signals from one of our planets and set off on a long rant about our culture and evolutionary origins. Millions have heard the message, as clearly intended. The outrage is palpable."
diplomatic.2.a:0 "[From.GetName] must immediately fire this bigot!"
