stellarite_events.1.name: "Stellarite? What Stellarite???"
stellarite_events.1.desc: "We have an interesting situation. Apparently, some of our scientists claimed to have discovered a new type of power source after spending a period of time scanning the energy signature with our advanced enigmatic sensors. These scientists claim that the power of stars can be turned into a power source that is more advanced than even Dark Matter.\n\nWe cannot yet verify the truth of this claim, as this seems to be related to solar power...which we have known even before our empires are capable of space-travel."
stellarite_events.1.a: "Interesting, we should explore this."
stellarite_events.1.b: "Solar power is known for hundred of years, stupid fool."
 
RESEARCH_STELLARITE_POWER: "The Star Beckons"
RESEARCH_STELLARITE_POWER_DESC: "Scientists from all across our empire will gather to debate and experiments on the truth of this new power source. It will take a considerable amount of time before such bold claim can be verified. There are many possible risks as well, this will not be easy."

RESEARCH_STELLARITE_POWER_AGAIN: "The Second Sun"
RESEARCH_STELLARITE_POWER_AGAIN_DESC: "Some of our scientists still believe there is a level of possibility within this new power source. A second convention is to be held to explore further, but this will take painfully long amount of time."

RESEARCH_STELLARITE_COMPONENTS: "Sons of Sun"
RESEARCH_STELLARITE_COMPONENTS_DESC: "We are still exploring all the possible combat applications of the new Stellarite Power. It will take a fair amount of time to come up with the design blueprints for our selected fields."

RESEARCH_STELLARITE_COPY: "Following the Trend"
RESEARCH_STELLARITE_COPY_DESC: "Someone just discovered new toys, so naturally the best course of action is to steal them for our own benifits. Mwa ha ha ha ha."

stellarite_events.2.name: "The Stellar"
stellarite_events.2.desc: "It is confirmed! After several failed experiments, the team has completed a rough test of this Stellarite power. The power does indeed exists, and can be used as power source. But we do not yet have a working prototype that can be used for military applications. We must dig deeper."
stellarite_events.2.desc.stellaritegate: "The records within the Gate heavily suggest the existences of Stellarite Power, which proves that this power did exist in the past. But we do not yet have a working prototype that can be used for military applications. We must dig deeper."
stellarite_events.2.tooltip: "Although it is now accepted that Stellarite is a potential power source, we still cannot create a reliably way to contain such powerful energy, we will need a highly skilled scientist in the enginerring departments to do this.\n\n§YThe scientist in question must be level 10, and have either Curator, Spark of Genius, Erudite, Chosen One, Sapient AI Assistant, Brainbug or Materials Expertise."


stellarite_events.3.name: "Project Leader Candidate"
stellarite_events.3.desc: "We must select one of our scientists to lead the overall project. This is an area we are not familiar with, and there may be many risks involved. So it is best that the selected candidate have some respectable resume.\n\nSome of our leaders object that it may also be unwise to risk valuable scientists to such untold dangers. WE must choose."
 
stellarite_events.4.name: "Critical Mission Failure"
stellarite_events.4.desc.a: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry!

stellarite_events.4.desc.d: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry! A sample was inserted into the Anti-Mass Spectrometers, and it caused the equipments to go critical. Bunch of weird aliens teleported in and killed everyone, the lab then exploded shortly afterwards, killing the team and the weird aliens"
stellarite_events.4.desc.e: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry! An unknown saboteur has set us up the bomb. Our team had no chance to survive, made their time. The lab exploded and all our bases are belong to none."
stellarite_events.4.desc.f: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry! Just as when things are going smoothly. One of the scientists lashed out in anger when he realized that the upcoming game he was so hyped about will be exclusive to Epoch Games. He smashed the terminal in anger, and accidently set the whole lab to explode."
stellarite_events.4.desc.g: "Terrible news! The project to study the new power source has gone awry! The Supervisor and some of the teams were on an elevator when it suddenly malfunctioned due to power shortage. The elevator exploded, and destroyed the entire lab."

stellarite_events.10.a: "No, it is the creature who shall be eaten."
stellarite_events.10.b: "Again? Fine, eat it. We certainly won't stop existing."

stellarite_events.12.name: "Kaboom!"
stellarite_events.12.desc: "Due to our reckless use of Stellarite Reactors on [FROM.GetName], the generators suffer meltdown after prolonged exposure to each other's massive heatwaves. This results in a powerful explosion that blows up the reactor and turn some of our populations into ashes of history."
stellarite_events.12.a: "Oops."

stellarite_events.13.name: "Massive XPLOSION!"
stellarite_events.13.desc: "Due to our reckless use of Stellarite Reactors on [FROM.GetName], the generators suffer critical meltdown after a technician pressed the wrong button after prolonged working hours. The generators blew up and caused a massive apocalypse that wipes out the colony. Reports indicate that all pops are now properly barbequed.\n\nA team of medics has been sent in an attempt to heal the survivors, but there are no survivors."
stellarite_events.13.a: "Excell...wait no this is very bad news indeed!"

stellarite_events.14.name: "Final Destination"
stellarite_events.14.desc: "Due to our reckless use of Stellarite Reactors on [FROM.GetName], one of the technicians responsible for maintaining the systems have accidently fell down the generator shaft and caused the entire building to explode.

acot_stellarite_chain: "Stellar Power"
acot_stellarite_chain_title: "Stellar Power"
acot_stellarite_chain_desc: "There are theories and evidences that power of the stars itself can be harnessed into powerful weapons beyond what is currently known. Details are skeptic but given enough resources and commitment, more information may be revealed."

acot_stellarite_experiment: "To Be or not to Be?"
acot_stellarite_experiment_desc: "Details are currently too sketchy, most of the science boards are skeptical of this so-called Stellarite power. There has been no records of any civilizations utilizing this power, not even the precursors. Given that concepts of solar energy has been widely known and adapted, there is very little reason to believe that there is more to it.\n\nRegardless, a group of scientists are willing to experiment, but an experienced scientist will be required to lead the project. While the scientist is not required to abandon the current task, only a few seems to display interests in such project. Risks are high, so we should be careful with our approach."

acot_stellarite_research: "Mastering the Stars"
acot_stellarite_research_desc: "Now that it is clear that Stellarite is indeeed a formidable new power source. The next obstacle is to explore how to utilize the power in space warfare. Our early prototypes were too unstable and too dangerous to be used practically. As such, it is important that we develop a safe shielding device that can contain such powers without causing major explosion when subjected to various hazardous reactions.\n\nTo this end, a gifted scientist in the Engineering Field will be required. The Scientist must either have Spark of Genius, Curator, Sapient AI Assistant, Erudite, Brainslug or Materials Expertises (Skill Level of 10 is also needed)"
