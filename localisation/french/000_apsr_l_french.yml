 apsr.2.title:0 "Unique planets"
 apsr.2.desc:0 "[Root.GetRulerTitle], while observing a supernova, our astronomers received an encrypted signal originating from a planet in an otherwise unremarkable system situated near the exploding star. Although we have managed to decrypt it, the better part of the message was distorted by the explosion. However, the general idea of the contents was inferred. The message speaks of wonderous planets present within our galaxy; from planets made entirely of strange materials to ones where mysterious alien artifacts reside. The location of such places must have been part of the lost fragments of the signal. While we do not know who sent it, we remain hopeful the contents weren't a lie, and that someday we may find at least one of these planets."

Bequeathed they had been to live in peace, never knowing disease, hunger, war or any suffering. It was a time of prosperity and piety, as life grew and glorified its creators. Yet such golden age couldn't last, for the Dark Day arrived. The sky rained fire, bringing death and terror. The Ancients rose up in defense of all that was living; thus they ascended into the heavens and stopped the Evil that brought forth such destruction. After this final gift they had bestowed upon their creations, they were never seen again...»§! \n§WLegends of the Ancient Creators, makers of all that can be seen.§!\n\nThe culture of this empire is suffused with legends of a mighty race that protected and guided them, before ascending into heavens to defend them from a great Evil, never to be seen again, though tales speak of their eventual return. The existence of this species is confirmed by records found in ancient ruins. Modern technology has enabled further study in such places, revealing dated star maps, poiting to certain space objects which may represent planets that have belonged to these Ancients."
