  spacerift.10.name: "Space Rifts: A fracture in space!"
  spacerift.10.desc: "Our physicists have been detecting time dialations and gravitorial annomalies. After studying these sparce events, they came to the conclusion that space itself is collapsing.\n\nA select group of physicists and astronomers have been dedicating the last decade to study these annomalies and successfully predicted that space itself would start creating rifts that could, in theory, be used to instantly travel across the galaxy.\n\nAs predicted, the first space rift has been detected. We should expect many more in the upcomming years."
  #  A group of scientists believe that, with the proper funding, they could stabalize space-time within our borders.
  spacerift.10.a: "Interesting"
  # spacerift in system detected
  spacerift.11.name: "New Space Rift detected!"
  spacerift.11.desc: "Due to the continued erosion of the space-time fabric, a new rift was opened within our borders!\n\nThe new Space Rift could prove a strategic advantage against our enemies or a weakspot in our defenses\n\nOur military strongly suggest taking this matter as a priority."
