 PLAGUE_CURE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "The Collectors have accidentaly unleashed a plague that is spreading accross the galaxy. They requested our help in finding a cure against it!\n\nThe first empire to find the cure will get the Nyblax Eye relic from them.\n\nIn the mean time, our scientists suggest §Yisolating our systems§!. This includes closing borders, breaking migration treatis, leaving any kind of alliance or research agreement. By doing so we will be able to decelerate the incomming plague spread from our neighbours and allies.\nThey also suggested implementing the §YQuarantine Planetary Decision§! on each planet to avoid further contagion."
