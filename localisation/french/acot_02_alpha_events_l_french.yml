 acot_alpha_tech_chain: "Mystery of the Precursors"
 acot_alpha_tech_chain_title: "Mystery of the Precursors"
 acot_alpha_tech_chain_desc: "Evidences of a more advanced enigmatic technologies utilized by the ancient precursors have been found across multiple reference points. The term "Precursor Databank Archive" has been mentioned multiple times. Our scientists believe that this archive must be the key to the secrets of the past, an ancient cache of technologies to be opend."
 acot_precursor_tech_find: "Prototype Reactor"
 acot_dm_tech_find_enigmatic_desc: "While we cannot harness the power of Dark Matter yet, our scientists are quite confident that we can begin developing a prototype enigmatic energy first. While this is not a requirement, it should provide a good stepping stone for our ship technologies. This point of interest will be removed at the conclusion of Dark Designs Event."

 war_goal_acot_wg_steal_databank: "Technology Acquisition"
 war_goal_acot_wg_steal_databank_desc: "War is declared to acquire technologies off the opposing force who clearly demonstrate the lack of common senses to properly utilize such technologies."
 casus_belli_acot_cb_databank_claim: "Knowledge is Power"
 casus_belli_acot_cb_databank_claim_desc: "This empire possesses key knowledges that will further the progress of the greater good, but their inability to be smart about it demands that such knowledges be passed down to someone who is smarter."
 acot_cb_databank_claim: "Knowledge is Power"
 acot_cb_databank_claim_desc: "This empire possesses key knowledges that will further the progress of the greater good, but their inability to be smart about it demands that such knowledges be passed down to someone who is smarter."

 acot_alpha_matter_events.1.name: "Mystery of the Precursors"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1.desc: "Some of our scientists have been studying the technologies behind the designs of the fallen one's spaceships in an effort to find possible improvements for our technologies. What they have discovered is however something far more interesting. Apparently the energy readings from the technologies utilized by  the fallen ones seem to be far lower than one would have expected from dark matter and dark energy-based systems.\n\nAfter a lengthy process of searching and studying, it appears that all of the current technologies utilized by the fallen ones are extremely downscaled and simplified versions of their original prototypes. The term "Precursor Databank Archives" has been heavily referenced across multiple evidences. We believe that the next stage of dark matter evolution lies within this Databank. We must find a way to access it."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.1.a: "And we shall."

 acot_alpha_matter_events.2.name: "Databank Analysis Completed!"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.2.desc: "The analysis of the databank is completed and the database is ready for installation. The Databank can be accessed from the diplomatic screen at any time moving forward. Shall we access the databank now?"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.2.a: "Access the databank, we have much to do."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.2.b: "Not now, we will access it later."

 acot_databank_attack_fe: "Triumph By Combat"
 acot_databank_attack_fe_desc: "The Fallen Ones must possess one of these databanks. With enough military strengths, we can simply take a battle to them directly and challenge them in glorious combat, with the price being the databank of course."

 acot_databank_trick_fe: "Art of Deception"
 acot_databank_trick_fe_desc: "The Fallen Ones must possess one of these databanks. Perhaps if we gain enough favor with the Fallen Ones, they can be tricked to allow us to gain access to the databank if wee pamper them with enough praises. We simply need them to have high opinions of us somehow."

 acot_alpha_matter_events.100.name: "Precursor Databank Acquired"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.100.desc: "We have successfully acquired a copy of Precursor Databank, now all we need is to analyze and decipher the arcane arts behind it so that it may guide us further in our pursuits of the precursor's ancient histories."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.100.a: "Let us move forward!"

 RESEARCH_PRECURSOR_DATABANK: "Decipher Precursor Databank"
 RESEARCH_PRECURSOR_DATABANK_DESC: "Before any more progress on the Precursor Study can begin, we must first learn how to operate and decipher the Precursor Databank and its AI Assistance first."

 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.name: "Incoming Transmission From You-Know-Who"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.desc.spiritualist: "[root.GetName], it has come to our attentions that your empire is seeking knowledges of the past precursors such as ours. What exactly do you plan to accomplish.\n\nYou are not trying to find our weaknesses, are you? Given that you have been such a good follower to the faith, we permit you the chance to explain your actions this once."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.desc.materialist: "This is [From.GetRulerName] addressing to [root.GetRulerName]. Our intelligences have detected that your scientists have been seen snooping around the technologies of the old. Normal regulations suggest we confiscate all plebian's data regarding the dangerous acquisition of forbidden artifacts, but since you have shown to be trustworthy in the past, I shall give you the opportunity to not waste both of our times by explaining to me what is your goal.\n\nHurry up and get this over with, I have some new games to play and I don't want to be here long."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.desc.xenophile: "Greetings to you, [root.GetName]. Rumors suggest that your empire is looking for some old datas regarding the ancient civilizations such as ours. We want to know what is your objectives exactly? If you want to know the histories of extinct species, subscribe to Xenocovery Channel and donate and all the informations will be yours."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.desc.xenophobe: "Listen now, [root.GetSpeciesName]. You are amongst the more tolerable idiots in this galaxy, so tell us exactly what are you trying to do by meddling in the histories of our pasts? We have no times for games so do not try our patiences."

 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.a: "We want to bask in your empire's glorious achivements."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.a.response: "Are you now? How very humble.\n\nVery well, ennjoy your history lessons then, perhaps you will come to understand why we consider ourselves the superior civilizations. Your empire's history is but a fraction of our vast achievements, for ours is a story that spans for eons. Study well, and spread the words of our excellence. Let the...<blah blah blah>\n\n<5 hours later> ...ends the reign of our great expansion. Write those histories down and spread the words to the rest of the galaxy so that it may yet be saved.\n\n<<The agony that our ruler has been subjected to from hours of the Fallen Empire's self-glorifying braggings has caused [ruler.GetHerHim] to lose a portion of [ruler.GetHerHis] sanity, even if [ruler.GetHerHim] is immortal, hive mind, machine overlord, for none can endure such level of ten pounds of crap.>>"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.b: "What is a Fallen Empire? A misable little pile of secrets!"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.102.b.response: "Enough talk! Have at you!"

 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.name: "Alpha Project Report"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.desc.engi: "After extensive analysis of the Precursor's history of their designs, materials and components, our scientists has finally reached the conclusion that the majority of the reasons that led to the Project's failure lies in their imperferctions in the arts of Hard-Light generation. The density and power level  required to create such components were too large for them to reliably field on a massive scale. The technologies utilized by the Fallen Ones are extremely downscaled, cheaply made and easily reproducable components and materials which would not be feasable for Alpha Project.\n\nWith this knowledge, our engineers now have the rough estimation on how to best contain the powers generated from Alpha Project's devices."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.desc.hist: "Per our instructions, our archivists, historians and master libraians have completed their documentations regarding the reign of the Precursors and their vast histories. The chaotic influences of the Ascension War and the massive lack of coordinations between the science team, the political powers and the military leaders were the major factor that led to the failures of the Alpha Project. Major flaws in internal securities led to the Project being canceled after massive rejections made by various opposing factions, most of which were theorized to be agents employed by enemy powers.\n\nArmed  with this knowledge, our empire has come to a greater understanding of how important strength in unity plays a role in achieving great ambitions. We shall not fail. The Alpha Project will be completed under our flag."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.desc.phys: "Our science teams are pleased to report that their analysis on all Precursor's experimental records have been completed. The key to the success of Alpha Project lies in the optimal balances between Dark Matter and Dark Energy's convergence. The Precursors have failed multiple times to maintain the focus between them which results in massive explosions and a lot of black holes.\n\nAfter some minor setbacks of our owns, we have finally completed what they have failed. The Alpha Project gets closer and closer to its completion."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.3.a: "We move closer to our goals."

 acot_alpha_matter_events.4.name: "Alpha Project Finality"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.4.desc: "We are ready to begin the final stage of the Alpha Project. We have all the resources, the knowledges and the will to see this project through. The time for doubts and concerns are behind us.\n\nThere is no time to be lost! [root.GetSpeciesName]! Science Team! Today, the future is at our door!. We know our duty and we will do it. We fight for our honor, as [root.GetSpeciesName], as [root.GetName], and we fight in the name of [root.GetRulerName]!\n\nAnd if we fail this day, we fail in glory, we fail hero's failure...but we shall not fail NO! It is the enemy who will taste failure and defeat. AS YOU KNOW most of our science teams are stationed in space, prepared to deep strike."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.4.a: "For our future! For [root.GetName]!"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.4.b: "But we should fail anyway. Let's just forget about everything."

 acot_alpha_matter_events.5.name: "We are the Alpha. We are the Future."
 acot_alpha_matter_events.5.desc: "It is done, a new age is now upon us. As of today, [root.GetName] has surpassed all the precursors of old. Let the galaxy howl in fear and awe for we are the Alpha, the progenitor to the new age of Enigmatic Technologies. Let all the Fallen Ones be ware, for the tables have been turned. Their reigns is at an  end! Our enemies shall be undone!"
 acot_alpha_matter_events.5.a: "We are the ALPHA. We are the FUTURE."
