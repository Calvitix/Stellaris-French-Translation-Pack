 ### сообщение при исследовании планеты с ресурсом

 apsr.10011.desc:0 "At first, nothing stood out in particular on this piece of rock. However, once we started analysing the energetic field of the planet, we found out that in some places lingered a certain "quantum foam" - a type of energy made of "frozen" quants and electrons that weren't moving, but are ... moving at the same time. And the most strange thing about it is the big period of degradation. Maybe we can exploit it for our interests?"
