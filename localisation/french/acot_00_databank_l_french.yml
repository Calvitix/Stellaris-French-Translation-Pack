The Alpha Project is your local galaxy's fallen empires attempting to understand and improve their existing technologies, or what you guys call the Delta Tech. Obviously, without the Cache or the Ancient Council for guidance, they failed horribly at trying to enter mass-production stage of it. I mean they even get the name of the power wrong.\n\nI assume you're asking this because you seek to upgrade your Delta technologies?

However, perhaps if you can piss them off enough by obtaining technologies beyond what they could possess, they'd certainly try to rob it from you first! You just then have to win the war and demand they honor their own wargoals and make them surrender those precursor data in return!\n\nBased on their unfathomable level of arrogance, I estimates 102.07% with 2% chance of inaccuracy that they'd swallow it up and let you have the data! After all, they probably think you won't do anything good with them anyway. But proving them wrong is your specialty, yes?"
acot_precursor_databank.4000.b.response.nofe: "Precisely! Although...actually, I think they are all dead now. Guess robbing them is out of the question, sadly."

acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.escort: "Destroyers?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.escort.desc: "Right, the earliest design was likely going to be an Escort. A type of destroyer-cruiser hybrid, perhaps one of the more flexible and unique design relative to modern fleet doctrines."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.bc: "Battleships?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.bc.desc: "This one should be a Battleshi...no, battlecruisers. Yes, that's the one. Fuctionality-wise, its similar to how your battleships work, just with slightly more firepowers."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.titan: "Titans?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.titan.desc: "This one I think never got past early prototype. A type of flagship with specialized aura component. All I know is that it has been 100% replaced with a super simplified design that just straped a mining station on a constructor chassis. I think it's supposed to be call Hercu...wait that's another design. Oh yeah, Hyperion! That's the one!"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.pac: "Carriers?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.pac.desc: "I believe this one is supposed to be a hybrid assault carrier that can provide support with both long range weapons and large amount of strike craft hangars at the same time. Too bad, no one, not even the Yuukonite Federation had practical use for such a craft in their fleet doctrine, so it was mostly abandoned."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.guardian: "Defense Platforms?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.guardian.desc: "I think this one is a defense platform of some kind...hmm I think there's two of them but I can't remember which one this is. Based on the leftover data, it should be all-purpose defense stations."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.sentinel: "Ion Cannons?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.sentinel.desc: "This one is a defense station I think. But there's two of them, one is smaller and cheaper. I know that this one is designed to take out capital ships. May be wrong though."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.gate: "Something that guard doors?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.gate.desc: "Oooh this one I remembered was some kind of super super creepy ship that was used to open...a door? Wait no no, it's supposed to close the door not open it. I don't know why is it a combat ship though, I think they just decided to strap a bunch of weapon modules on it."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.oracle: "Science Ships?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.oracle.desc: "If I have to guess, this must be a science ship of some kind. I think it was made by someone who wanted a ship that could save others from dying. Ironic that the creators died before the prototype is even completed."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.initer: "Construction Ships?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.initer.desc: "I believe this one is a construction ship? The prototype ones are much larger and well armed. But there's no reason to arm one so they eventually nerf it down to basic."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.emiss: "Colony Ships?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.emiss.desc: "I remember this one!. Basically a prototype for next-gen colonizer/terraformer hybrid ship. The neat thing, I think, is that it can also work as an invasion unit."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.citadel: "Starbases?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.citadel.desc: "This one I think is a starbase. Way more powerful that the sorry excuses your Fallen Empire has right now, as it has actual components and upgrades befitting the power it contains."
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.enigmalith: "Megastructures?"
acot_precursor_databank.4.nodata.enigmalith.desc: "Oh yeah. During the early years of the Ascension War, the fallen ones need a way to stock up and replenish their reserves of dark energies. So they build these things called Enigmaliths. I think your empire may have seen a few of them. After the fools cut down on their territory controls, they also decommission most of the Enigmaliths as well. The design is not very complicated though, so long as you understand how the resources are generated."

acot_precursor_databank.400.desc: "§BPrecursor Escort§! Ah, one of the most spammable ships of the Ascension War! Fast, relatively cheap, adequately-equipped, it was the favorite of everyone in the past ever. Pity that your galaxy has only seen an extremely dumbed down version of it. Odder still is why did they call it Escorts though, it's not like any of their ships need escorting."
acot_precursor_databank.401.desc: "§BPrecursor Battlecruiser§! The staple of all ancient fleets, modelled after the gods's very own war vessels, it's the base template that pretty much half of later designs basically borrow from its core chassis and concepts. Still not sure why are they called battlecruisers instead of battleships in your galaxy though."
acot_precursor_databank.402.desc: "§BPrecursor Hyperion§! The very first adaptation of Precursor Technologies based on the battlecruisers! I believe this is the first time post-Ascension War empires attempt to create a titanic-sized weapon platform.

I believe the Fallen Empires of your galaxy has unfortunately decided to dumb down its design further and use mining platform chassis instead."
acot_precursor_databank.405.desc: "§BPrecursor Sentinel§! Defense systems designed for anti-capital ships. Although honestly, given by your galaxy standards, anything that's not an Escort probably pass as a capital ship anyway."
acot_precursor_databank.406.desc: "§BPrecursor Gatekeeper§! SOPHIA don't think this one should even be considered a Precursor design, since they kinda just copypasta the Ancient Design and just strip it off everything except to close doors...wait a minute, I just realized that's what they all did with pretty much every design!."
acot_precursor_databank.407.desc: "§BPrecursor Oracle§! Advanced armed exploration vessels like the Oracles here are pretty much mandatory back then. Danger exists everywhere, and if one values their lives, they better make sure their ships are up to the task."
acot_precursor_databank.408.desc: "§BPrecursor Initializer§! Establishing new fortifications in the past require not only powerful construction systems, but also one that can do it quickly and defend against small harassments. Sometimes its even a valid strategy to send in these ships into combat and construct quick disposable turrets to increase the odds."
acot_precursor_databank.409.desc: "§BPrecursor Emissary§! Another technology lost to time and age. The Emissaries perform all kinds of roles related to planetary colonization and manipulation. It's probably much more useful in your galaxy, seeing as how you seem to be wholly reliant on planet-bound economy over maximizing space efficiency. But SOPHIA won't judge!"
acot_precursor_databank.410.desc: "§BPrecursor Citadel§! Starbases like these are staple ways of maintaining proper territorial control in space. More so in the past when there are no real boundaries between systems. Any space that the starbase's weapon system are not in range were effectively considered free for the taking. The establishment of hyperlane routes and solar systems may have, oddly and unintentionally enough, become a necessary limitation."
acot_precursor_databank.411.desc: "§BPrecursor Herculean§! Enigmaliths are perhaps one of the few designs that the Fallen Ones, even in your sad galaxy, did not dare to dumb down or alter. Well, apart from harvesting the unnecessary dark matter that is."

They offer the destroyer's level of speed, maneuverability and flexibility with the cruiser's level of firepower and engagement range.

acot_precursor_databank.6.a.darkarmy: "§!War Has Changed...Or has it?\n\nWith the invention of advanced nano-technologies and hard-light manipulation, it is now possible to equip ground infantry divisions with enough firepowers and protections akin to armored vehicles.\n\nA standard equipment of Delta-Kill Team Squads includes various anti-personal and anti-material loadouts, personal kinetic and energy barriers, hard-light neutronium armor, techops helmet with real-time tactical display, satellite radar, short-ranged blink teleportion device, jump packs, auto-medkit and auto-rations that can last for up to 2 years.\n\nThe armor is also equipped with autocamo system, allowing infantry to disguise and blend in with the environment from named eyes, limited stealth system that are undetectable by most type of sensors at long range. The infantry is able to operate in hazardous zones such as radiation, heat, toxic, cold and underwater for up to 6 months before the suit's power supply need to be recharged, the process of which can be done by absorbing power from any advanced equipments.\n\n This tactical flexibility has pretty much made the use of most combat walkers and light armored vehicles quite obsolete. A squad is thus deployed alongside main battle tanks and fire support units from tactical deep strike. Despite what some blonde-haired vault-suit guy may insist, wars indeed have changed. Yet despite all these many advancements, infantries are still not expected to become the sole fighting forces, and Delta Invasion Forces still compose of various armored and fire support backups as well as tactical strategic deployment units."

acot_precursor_databank.6.a.clone: "§EGood Soldiers Follow Orders§!\n\nAlthough the cloning procedures have advanced greatly over the course of our history, the core issue still remains; the clones only inherit their parent's genetic templates, and not their memories and experiences. This is further marred by the lack of proper equipment to supply such an enormous legion of men. But that age is over, the invention of the Gene Seed Memory made by GenoTycoon Labs allows us to create a perfect replica of veteran soldiers and bounty hunters, all of which are linked genetically together in a hive-like structure, making them function effectively as one with perfect synchronization. The clones are then trained extensively against their own templates both individually and as a squad.\n\nThough the equipment given to the clones are slightly inferior to the ones employed by Delta Squads, they still possess enough flexibility and tactical uses that allows them to operate independently without needing to always rely on armored and fire support."

Once a legion is formed, they must each undergo a trial by combat against other legions, only the survivors may enter to become the Unsullied, whose loyalty has been tested and their minds indoctrinated to fight to the end. For freedom is an illusion invented by the weak to govern the poor.\n\nThe Unsullied may not be as well equipped or adapted as elite Delta Forces, but their losses are of little concern and their equipment easily replaceable.

The addition of Stellarite Miniatures Core eliminates many weaknesses present on the Delta Force's equipment. The most notable improvement is the elimination of power supply, as the Sigma Core can not only last for over thousand of years, the reactor can draw power from any external heat and light sources and replenish itself to full capacity within mere seconds, allowing the power armor to operate for centuries.\n\nAnother obvious improvement is their firepower and durability. The Mortus SAR-1 is equipped with both stellarite energy beams and stellarite kinetic rounds, allowing soldiers to fire both searing beam and deadly shredder cannons at equal precision.\n\nThe same improvements have been made to the ARmored and Artillery Fire Support units as well, the new Ornellaia-class MBT can rain down fury with their main cannons and Stellar Refractor allows the tank to project intense stellar beams to any ships in orbit  which can then be redirected to any ground positions across the entire planet."

The device will then be armed and its shielding deactivated upon reaching certain altitude where its detonation can no longer be prevented by planetary shields to generate an instantaneous explosion that not only engulfs the selected battlezone in searing infernal, the massive stellar radiations will spread and cause further damage. To prevent excessive usages, only field commanders with Level Four Clearance and above may issue a Solar Bomb deployment.

The tank chassis is reinforced with heavy hard-light platings and advanced dark energy shields, allowing them to shrug off even the most powerful anti-tank weapons.\n\nBut as we all know, tank warfare is not about how tough the tank is, it is about mobility and speed; the tank that fires the first shot always win. And as such. the tank is equipped with miniaturized jump drives, allowing it to strike where our enemies least expected. The tank can freely swap between treads, hover, amphibious, subterrain and underwater mode, making it truly ALL-TERRAIN.\n\nThe tank utilizes Eldar Mass Accelerator Cannon as its standard main turret weapon, but can also be retrofitted with energy lances or emitters as needed.

For example, they are able to utilize both jump jets, blink and jump drives into underwater and quickly back into the air before performing triple 360 spin back into the ground and continue to operate normally with any drops in performance. A regular Delta Trooper would have become too dizzied or confused at such a rapid change in combat configurations.\n\nThey are also able to wield much deadlier weapons than a typical infantry, including even ship-sized armaments.\n\nBut what truly seperates them as unique combat forces is that the SCS-900 does not actually possess any critical weaknesses that would render any of their parts inoperable. A test has been made by firing a Thermal Lance on an SCS-900 without any protection, though he is blown into pieces, all of his parts are still operational and continue to perform their functions and with only a brief repair, is fully reassembled to continue fighting. Another test involve close combat analysis, where 100 soldiers are pitted against an SCS-900, the soldiers are caught in a surprise when the SCS-900 suddenly detach all of his components and turn into 100 different parts each relentlessly attacking and subduing all  the soldiers at once.\n\nDespite this fact, there is one drawback. Being fully synthetic means that the SCS-900 is not immune to fear or self-preservation, and there are reports in which the SCS-900s may disobey their directives against unwinnable odds or if their self-preservation overrides the importance of mission objectivess."
