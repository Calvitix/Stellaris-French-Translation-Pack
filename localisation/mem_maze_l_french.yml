 mem_maze.2.name:0 "La structure perdue"
#  mem_maze.2.desc.m:0 "The demolition of a large mountain range on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has opened the way to a valley we were unaware of before. Inside it, landscape engineers have found an alien structure of some sort. Impervious to scans, it appears to be of highly advanced technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
 mem_maze.2.desc.j:0 "Lors de la suppression de la végétation dense sur §Y[Root.GetName]§!, les ingénieurs paysagistes ont fait une découverte étonnante. Auparavant camouflée par la prolifération des plantes, une structure extraterrestre s'est révélée. Imperméable aux numérisations, il semble être d'une technologie très avancée, mais primitif quant à la forme et au choix des matériaux. Les murs sont finement décorés par des formes abstraites et des images de scènes grotesques."
#  mem_maze.2.desc.q:0 "A minor retraction in a quicksand basin on §Y[Root.GetName]§! during a stabilization operation has led to an astounding discovery. An alien structure of a sort that was previously buried in sand resurfaced. Impervious to scans, it appears to be of highly advanced technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
#  mem_maze.2.desc.g:0 "The vaporization of a glacier on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has led to an astounding discovery. An alien structure that was previously entirely encased in ice revealed itself. Impervious to scans, it appears to be of highly advanced technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
#  mem_maze.2.desc.k:0 "Clearing out the kelp coverage on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has produced something astounding. What was thought to be a small island covered in kelp has turned out to hide a large and mysterious alien structure. Impervious to scans, it appears to be of highly advanced technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
 mem_maze.2.desc.machine: "En supprimant la végétation dense sur §Y[Root.GetName]§!, nous avons découvert une structure extraterrestre. Imperméable aux scanners, elle semble être d'une technologie très avancée, mais pourtant primitive quant à la forme et au choix des matériaux. \n\nToutes les tentatives pour l'explorer ont échoué, car toutes les unités que nous avons envoyées, peu importe leur blindage, ont été instantanément désactivées à mesure qu'elles approchaient."
 mem_maze.2.desc.hive: "En supprimant la végétation dense sur §Y[Root.GetName]§!, nous avons découvert une structure extraterrestre. Imperméable aux numérisations, il semble être d'une technologie très avancée, mais primitif quant à la forme et au choix des matériaux. \n\nTout drone que nous avons essayé d'envoyer pour regarder de plus près, cependant, a été coupé de nous et s'est rapidement flétri, nous empêchant d'explorer davantage le site."
 mem_maze.2.gest: "Quelle allure étrange..."
 
 mem_maze.4.name:0 "Structure Alien"
 mem_maze.4.desc:0 "Une mystérieuse structure extraterrestre sur §Y[Root.GetName]§! attire l'attention des scientifiques et des spectateurs profanes. La spéculation va bon train, mais peu ont pu suggérer des théories cohérentes concernant l'origine de la structure. \n\nL'une des théories les plus prometteuses est que l'extérieur de la pyramide est une sorte de "verrou d'un puzzle géant". Faut-il autoriser une tentative de descellement?"
 mem_maze.4a:0 "Oui, préparez tout ce dont nous avons besoin."
 mem_maze.4b:0 "Nous ne devons pas jouer imprudemment avec des objets aliens."

 mem_maze.5.name:0 "Labyrinthe Alien"
 mem_maze.5.desc:0 "Attempts to navigate the images and patterns engraved on the surface of the mysterious structure have finally yielded results. Pressing them in the correct order caused a hidden doorway to open, revealing the way inside. \n\nThe interior of the structure appears to be an endless maze of corridors, twisting and delving underground. We do not detect any energy sources, but the walls are glowing softly, enabling vision."
 mem_maze.5a:0 "We need to explore it further."
 
 mem_maze.6.name:0 "Failure of the First Expedition"
 mem_maze.6.desc:0 "As the team descended into tunnels, we lost all contact with them. \n\nWe waited a long time in hope of their return with good news, but the wait dragged on far longer than expected. Finally, one of the team members emerged from the depths of the maze, half-crazed and exhausted. They revealed that, as they navigated the maze, the team leader accidentally triggered a trip wire, which caused a giant boulder to roll through the corridor and squash them all, except for the sole survivor."
 mem_maze.6a:0 "We will try again, taking rolling boulders into account."
 mem_maze.6b:0 "This is unacceptable risk, seal the maze."
 mem_maze_cancellation: "We seal off the maze and will never return. \n§RThis decision can never be revised. Never.§!"
 
 mem_maze.7.name:0 "Failure of the Second Expedition"
 mem_maze.7.desc:0 "The second team was armed with advanced knowledge of mechanical traps and equipped with devices to evade them. As previously, we lost contact with them as they descended into the maze. We waited fruitlessly for some time, until several survivors emerged from the maze. \n\nThey told us that, despite their success in avoiding the traps, they were thwarted by some kind of puzzle guarding a door. It involves rearranging colourful beads fixed on the wireframe of a hypercube in order to somehow remove them by using extra dimensions. When the team failed to solve the puzzle, most of them were melted by an unknown form of radiation. Sketches carried by survivors should make it possible to decipher the solution in advance."
 mem_maze.7a:0 "We will try again, bringing our finished homework."
 
 mem_maze.8.name:0 "Failure of the Third Expedition"
 mem_maze.8.desc:0 "With access to our advanced computation machines, we were able to provide the team with a solution to the puzzle. Once more we lost contact as they departed, and once again we awaited their return. Eventually, a single survivor emerged from the maze with a new tale of failure. \n\nThis time, the team evaded the traps and successfully solved the hypercube puzzle. However, as they advanced further, they found themselves in a room with several slabs covered in riddles. Some were trivial to crack, but others were not. As the team discovered, mistakes were fatal. After almost the entire team was electrocuted by lightning bolts from the slabs, the last survivor chose to retreat and bring back the news, along with a transcript of all the riddles."
 mem_maze.8a:0 "We have gone too far. The riddles won't stop us."

 mem_maze.9.name:0 "Failure of the Fourth Expedition"
 mem_maze.9.desc:0 "A committee composed of our empire's most brilliant scientists, philosophers, folklorists and tabletop gamers provided the team with a list of what they believed to be solutions to the riddles in the maze. As they departed once again, we worriedly awaited their return. Eventually, several survivors have returned from the maze, again with bad news. \n\nDespite solving the riddle slabs with minimal casualties, the team was stopped by a complex mechanical puzzle that required the use of elaborate mechanisms and weights composed of exotic matter to produce a safe passage through a room without a floor, suspended over an abyss. In an attempt to solve the puzzle, the room was somehow rotated around the horizontal axis, fatally smashing most of the them into the ceiling. \n\nThe survivors were carrying a detailed scheme of the room, which should allow us to test solutions inside a virtual simulation first."
 mem_maze.9a:0 "We are almost there. We can't stop now."
 
 mem_maze.10.name:0 "Results of the Fifth Expedition"
 mem_maze.10.desc:0 "We prepared extensively before sending §Y[officer.GetName]§!'s team on the mission. As they departed, we patiently waited for the news. Suddenly, the radio silence was broken. It appears §Y[officer.GetName]§! made it to the centre of the maze! \n\n[officer.GetSheHeCap] describe[officer.GetSXX] a large hall with a brightly glowing green orb seated on the pedestal in the middle. According to the scientist, it's nothing like [officer.GetSheHe] [officer.GetHasHave] seen before. [officer.GetSheHeCap] think[officer.GetSXX] it is somehow... alive? \n\nSuddenly, the signal is interrupted. We are now receiving another signal originating from the same area!"
 
 mem_maze.11.desc:0 "We welcome you, wanderers. You have found us, and by doing so, proven your worth and determination. You are worthy of our audience. Worthy of our knowledge. \n\nBut first tell us, what is the greatest virtue for you?"

 mem_maze.13.name:0 "Our Scientists Return"
 mem_maze.13.desc:0 "§Y[officer.GetName]§!'s team has emerged triumphant from the maze. They have trouble recollecting what really happened, but there is a spark of madness in their eyes. They demanded immediate access to the datapads, pens and paper, sticks and a patch of dirt, anything. After spending many hours drawing and writing, they appear to have returned to normal. Their works, meanwhile, appear to contain several of the answers many of our people have been searching for since the dawn of time!"
 mem_maze.13a:0 "We have learned so much."
 mem_maz.13a.tooltip: "Alien Maze will now produce a new job. Its output will depend on answers we provided."
