It was used in a similar way to how transnational/planetary collective governments are structured.\n\nThe civilization of §H[from.from.GetName]§! was on the verge of a global conflict, because of the rising tension between the member countries of the transnational government.\n\nThe tensions arose because of the lack of an important resource on §H[from.from.GetName]§!, which was called 'Gonva'.\n\nOur scientists were not able to identify the said resource solely based on the undamaged records on the station, but it was essential for the integrity of their society.\n\nThe struggle between the nations ultimately led to a thermonuclear war, which of course, devastated §H[from.from.GetName]§!"

Singular plants or rather plant colonies function like singular neurons or synapses.\n\nThe 'Planet-Plant-Brain' appears to posses some primitive form of consciousness, like that of animals, but still really different.\n\nAttempts to communicate with the brain led to failures, which are either based on the fact that the brain is not advanced enough for logical operations. like thoughts, or is not able to communicate at all.\n\nRegardless of the brains consciousness, its functionality gave us insight into advanced networking mechanics, which we can use to research technologies that are beneficial for our own networks."

Said planet appears to be the cracked one in this system.\n\nThe confusing part about the station is the fact, that it is completely abandoned. Not a single form of biological life has been found, not even microbes within the artificial atmosphere. It appears that the colony has been entirely stripped of life, by an unknown event.\n\nAll records of a time period lasting about 17 minutes, have been corrupted 32 years and 121 days ago for unknown reasons. It is possible that the incident that led to the vanishing of all life on the station, happened within those 17 minutes.\n\nOur scientists are discussing whether it would be preferable to occupy the significant technology of the station and leave, due to the mysterious vanishing of the former inhabitants, or if it could be used as a valuable colony for our people."

Analysis of their pseudo-genetic basis led to the revelation that these lifeforms are truly inorganic biological lifeforms. Unlike machines, which are inorganic but not biological.\n\nThe conditions for the development of inorganic life are incredibly complex and rare, which is why there has almost none been discovered before.\n\nThe unique biological composition of their cells, makes use of intense high-temperature oxidation mechanisms and a simple but still formidable metallic liquid, which serves as their 'blood', to generate metabolic processes.\n\nThis gives them the ability to survive and flourish within this extreme environment.\n\nSingular celled but also multicellular organisms have been discovered, all capable of asexual reproduction.

By who and why the toxin was created, was unknown to the general population of the planet.\n\nEven records of governmental and scientific institutions, didn't reveal the origin of the Scarlet Scourge. This doesn't mean that the government never knew about it.\n\nAll that is known is that the toxin suddenly appeared at a specific location, somewhere in the northern hemisphere called 'ORIGIN Site', 321 galactic standard years ago.\n\nIt spread rapidly via the winds, due to its airborne nature and covered the planet within a year.\n\nFurthermore, the toxin is composed of particles of varying sizes, from the size of dust particles to the size of large virions, which makes it extremely difficult to contain, while still being able to cover the sky and surfaces.\n\nThe toxin is able to replicate itself by means yet unknown, which explains why it was able to cover the whole planet.\n\nIn the end, the entire civilization and the planetary ecosystem was destroyed by the unstoppable Scarlet Scourge.\n\nOur scientists want to expand the exploration efforts on §H[from.from.GetName]§!, despite the dangers, to find the origin of the Scourge."

Animal life was also present.\n\nThe dome, composed of advanced isolation materials, was supposed to prevent the Scourge from leaking into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, even its creators underestimated its effects.\n\nThe Scourge corroded the domes material and leaked into the atmosphere, thus leading to the destruction of §H[from.from.GetName]§!'s civilization.\n\nThe records also revealed the coordinates of a location called 'The Repository', which apparently was the original main facility of the Innovation Forge and the place where,not only the Scourge was originally created, but their greatest creations in general.\n\nOur scientists want to travel to this location, in order to find out how the Scarlet Scourge was synthesized and unveil the secrets of this place."

The geological structure, the angle in relation to the planet's surface, which is orientated from the surface of the planet, 60 kilometers down to the upper mantle, and discovered unusual substances in the area, lead to the suspicion, that the Scar was created as the result of the deployment of an enormous kinetic weapon.

The two volumes are separated by possessing distinct vacuum energy densities.\n\nThe outer volume has a vacuum energy density virtually identical to that of the outside universe and is filled with hundreds of stars. Countless technological entities are located within the outer volume that appear to harness the energy of the stars, the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum energy and even extra-dimensional energies of an unknown origin.\n\nThe inner volume appears to be an empty void, filled purely with antiparticle-particle pairs from quantum fluctuations. However, it possesses a much larger vacuum energy density than the outer volume.\n\nOur conclusion gives rise to the assumption that the reason for the segregation of the volume into the two distinct ones is to generate ridiculously large amounts of energy! All the energy gets extracted within the outer volume and then siphoned into the inner volume. The energy content of the inner volume was determined to be at least 10^49 Joule, which is equivalent to the total mass-energy of a thousand stars.\n\nFurthermore, we were able to determine that the amplifiers and primordial pylons work in unison as energy and information distributors, which are scattered all throughout the galaxy. They are used to create a gigantic energy and information distribution network and are supposed to utilize the energy provided by $ehof_the_sphere$ to create quasi-negative mass. The amplifiers are repeaters of the enigmatic pattern, the sentient administration protocol of the galactic distribution network and generators for quasi-negative mass.\n\nThe primordial pylons are used to distribute the orders of the $ehof_the_sphere$ around the network and transmit information between amplifiers and $ehof_the_sphere$. This means that there are many more $ehof_cohesive$ systems in the galaxy, than we preciously anticipated!\n\nUnfortunately, we were still not able to determine what the initial purpose for this gigantic construct and the network is, but the most astonishing revelation is that $ehof_the_sphere$ is not the only construct of its type and there are at least a few more located somewhere outside of our galaxy.\n\nWhatever it is that the creators of these enormous constructs wanted to achieve, it needed more energy than thousands of stars could generate in their entire lifetime!

It is shaped in the form of an octahedron, with a diameter of exactly 2.5 kilometers at it's biggest extent.\n\nThe entire space around the object appears to be wobbling for unknown reasons, as if the object is projecting some sort of force field.

If the energy content differs even slightly, regardless if it is less or higher, the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ will not react to the transmission and neutralize the gravielectromagnetic wave. Second, the kind of wave, which transports the $ehof_epcs$ sequence, needs to be gravielectromagnetic.\n\nThe reason for this appears to be that the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ won't get activated by other forms of radiation, with the same energy content necessary to activate the $ehof_gateway_disableds$. Third, the enigmatic pattern code sequence needs to be tuned perfectly to activate the $ehof_gateway_disabled$.\n\nThis serves as a way to ensure that the $ehof_gateway_disabled$ is only getting activated when truly needed and not accidentally. The crew was also able to gain additional knowledge about $ehof_sm$ from the amplifier.\n\nWith the new information the crew as able to extract from the amplifier database, they were able to further manipulate the orders of the A.I. routine to the point, that it might be possible to use $ehof_sm$, not only for self-regenerative structures composed of $ehof_sm$, but even to use it to regenerate other, non-$ehof_sm$ structures. By adding additional orders, dedicated to the repair of systems $ehof_sm$ is attached to or integrated into, it might be possible to use $ehof_sm$ for the repair of structures like ship hulls. The crew of the drilling unit is preparing themselves to head back to the surface."

It is distinct from all the others, which are used simply for activating the $ehof_gateway_disableds$, turning them into $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$ and transporting the $ehof_epcs$ between $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$.

We now know that the nanite particles, the substance is composed of, are connected through an astonishingly advanced and complex network, with each nanite serving as neurons, eyes and hands, effectively making it a hive mind.\n\nEach nanite perceives the environmental information and instantly distributes it over the whole substance for the inherent A.I. routine to process it with the help of each nanite as processors. They then all get the orders from the routine at once, explaining the extremely fast adaptation mechanism of $ehof_sm$. The hive mind of the $ehof_sm$ is so advanced, that its computational capacity dwarfs even our largest quantum-computer networks and gives rise to the hypothesis, that it might not only be sentient, but even self-aware.\n\nNonetheless, with this new knowledge about $ehof_sm$, we might be able to use the $ehof_sm$ Hive Mind's extreme computational capacity, to create systems which are controlled by the $ehof_sm$ Hive Mind.

It is entirely unknown if the energy even comes from the outside or if the constructs harness local vacuum energy or shroud energy to power themselves, but based on the immense energy content each of these constructs possess, it is unlikely that they make use of local vacuum energy, as it would not be sufficient enough to generate said energy content.\n\nIf so, there must still be an additional source of energy.

It is neither solid nor liquid nor gaseous nor a plasma. It is all of them at once! Even ultra high or ultra low energy states of matter appear to exist within the surface's composition, like Bose-Einstein-Condensates, degenerate matter and even photonic matter.\n\nThe surface is also glowing on its own from time to time, at different locations, probably because of the decay of photonic matter and the constant phase transitions. Based on our knowledge about $ehof_sm$ and the fact that all the other primordial structures are made of it, it is likely that the surface is made out of the same material.

What's noteworthy is that it appears to possess specific colour schemes, that are the same almost all over construct. A gold-silver and orange. How all of this works is absolutely unknown.\n\nTwo circular shaped areas, which can only be defined as the 'poles' of this sphere, because perfect spheres don't have poles, are distinct from the main surface structure.

    ehof_reality_code.005.name:0 "Reality Code - $ehof_sm$"
    ehof_reality_code.005.desc:0 "After the return of the crew, both the enigmatic pattern sequence fragment and the sample of the substance which makes up the amplifier, were passed to our scientific institutions.With the help of the samples from inside the amplifier, we were able to learn much about the self-replicating, alien substance. It is composed of an array of hyper-advanced nano-machines, which are able to replicate themselves and together, can mimic many different forms of matter, and physical and chemical properties.\n\nThe way the substance behaves, makes it almost appear that the substance is not only alive, but even sentient. It is able to react to numerous different environmental conditions, with all its reactions being dedicated to adapting to the condition and ensuring the integrity of itself. Different forms of reactions have been observed.\n\nReplication, rearrangement and reshaping, in order to make the substance immune against any kind of damaging physical or chemical effect. Extreme heat, cold and corrosiveness, intense electromagnetic fields, different forms of radiation, mechanical pressure, lasers, even gravity. There seems to be no upper limit to the efficiency of its adaptive abilities, at least none we are able to determine.\n\nOther than its ability to transform and multiply to preserve itself, the structure is also capable of 'growing'. Its replicative abilities come in two different forms. The first form of replication appears when the substance needs to adapt to damaging environmental effects, at which it appears to be able to replicate itself out of nothing, perhaps by absorbing the energy or matter of the damaging effects itself, or by using an undetectable energy source.\n\nIn this case, the substance doesn't or only insignificantly increases its volume. The second form of replication appears, when the substance has adapted to any damaging effects and is in contact or close proximity to available matter or energy. It absorbs these to increase its volume, to 'grow', and can apparently absorb almost any known form of matter and energy.\n\nOnly gravitational energy, Dark Matter and Quasi-Negative Mass could not be absorbed. What the purpose of this 'growth' is, is unknown, but based on the reports about the amplifier, it didn't happen inside the amplifier itself, even though our crew and their tools were in direct contact to the substance. It appears that the substance is capable of being 'aware' about its environment and depending on the circumstances, react differently.\n\nOur scientists decided to name the substance '$ehof_sm$', as an analogy to Living Metal, due to its similarities. Even though we still know almost nothing about the substance or rather how it works, our scientific community is convinced that it possesses an unimaginable technological potential and they want to intensify our research on the substance and also the amplifiers. Not only to find out more about the enigmatic pattern, but also about the $ehof_sm$.\n\nThe uses for $ehof_sm$ may be limited for now, as we still know too few about it, to utilize it to its fullest extent, but our scientists developed designs for the construction of specialized facilities, dedicated to the reproduction of $ehof_sm$, by feeding it minerals and energy. Additionally, a project to investigate an Primordial Stones has been requested, as our scientists believe that they may have been constructed by the same entities that built the amplifiers, and could thus also be composed of $ehof_sm$."
