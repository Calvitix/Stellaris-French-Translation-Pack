lly been sent to $ehof_trader_new_system$. They terraformed $ehof_trader_new_system$ into a suitable system for the people of $ehof_trader_dominion$. Surprisingly, the system was not the only thing that changed. The flow of time began to change the machines and they became self-aware, thinking machines that grew to love $ehof_trader_new_system$ and wanted it for their own, a development which was not tolerable for $ehof_trader_dominion$. Extrasolar expansion was the only option and now there was a terraformed, suitable system, not far away, ready to be colonized and now their very own creations, made especially for that purpose, choose to keep the system for themselves. This lead to tensions between $ehof_trader_dominion$ and $ehof_trader_machines$, which would lead to a vast conflict, we refer to as, the Great War.\n\n$ehof_trader_dominion$ and the $ehof_trader_machines$ waged war and fought over the possession of $ehof_trader_new_system$. The biggest problem for both parties was that their strength were evenly matched, no side could really win the war. $ehof_trader_dominion$s psionic supremacy versus the technological-mechanical genius of $ehof_trader_machines$. If the war would have continued the way it was, it would have led to the extinction of both, $ehof_trader_dominion$ and $ehof_trader_machines$. An event $ehof_trader_d$ saw as likely. In order to prevent the extinction of all intelligent life in the systems, $ehof_trader_d$ proposed a solution which would not only end the war, but also solve the problems between $ehof_trader_dominion$ and $ehof_trader_machines$, The Amalgamation.\n\nThe Amalgamation, the unification of the organic people of $ehof_trader_dominion$ and the mechanical Excognitor, would bring birth to a new, ascended kind of beings, The $ehof_trader$, us, having the strength and wisdom of both kinds, without any of the flaws.\n\nAfter the Amalgamation was carried out and our people were born, we made it our goal to create a perfect utopia in $ehof_trader_new_system$, the system our forerunners fought for, and have since left $ehof_trader_old_system$ as a monument to the sins of those who came before us."

    ehof_mega_trader.007.c:0 "What is $ehof_trader_d$ and $ehof_trader_t$?"
    ehof_mega_trader.007.c.response:0 "$ehof_trader_d$ is an immaterial entity, which inhabits $ehof_trader_realm$. It has yet to be revealed, if $ehof_trader_d$ inhabits its realm and is a separate entity, or if it is the realm itself.\n\n$ehof_trader_realm$ is a part of the multiverse's, inter-dimensional fabric of $ehof_shroud$.\n\n$ehof_shroud$ has countless entities, of which $ehof_trader_d$ is a youngling of, which was born long ago, when $ehof_trader_dt$ originally emerged. This created both, the permanent connection to $ehof_shroud$ and $ehof_trader_realm$ itself, and in turn $ehof_trader_d$.\n\nWhen $ehof_trader_dt$ was created is unknown, but it was probably before our organic forerunners emerged on their home world. $ehof_qnm$ is what keeps $ehof_trader_dt$ open, but it is also what allows us to open the wormholes to other systems and keep them open.\n\nUnfortunately, we need to extract the $ehof_qnm$ from $ehof_trader_dt$, to use it for our wormholes. With $ehof_qnm$ being a limited resource, this would one day either mean, that we cannot construct any additional wormholes anymore and permanently halt our expansion, or it would lead to the collapse of $ehof_trader_dt$ and cut our connection to $ehof_trader_d$, which would lead to the loss of our psionic abilities and $ehof_trader_d$ guidance. Both of these events could or would lead to the collapse of our civilization, which is why we need your $ehof_qnm$ to keep expanding and stabilize $ehof_trader_dt$."

    annihilator_dialog.001.desc:0 "Greetings inhabitants of Galaxy-XY1527, I am a $NAME_Stellar_Annihilator_Species$, also refereed to as $ehof_the_stellar_annihilator$. I have been sent by $ehof_the_creators$ to destroy the Living-Dark-Matter-Subject001, $ehof_the_compound$.\n\nAs you've probably already noticed, its motivations are total cosmic transmutation. Beginning with your home galaxy.\n\n$ehof_the_compound$ believes itself to be invincible. I've monitored its actions and to a certain degree, this is true. However it is ignorant to its biggest weakness. A fundamental flaw that is part of its very nature. All forms of dark matter will disintegrate when in contact with $ehof_qnm$. This is its eternal weakness."
    annihilator_dialog.001.response:0 "So $ehof_qnm$ is the key?"

    annihilator_dialog.002.desc:0 "With negative mass enhanced weapons, or weapons that use negative mass directly, $ehof_the_compound$ can be destroyed. Its very existence is only possible, due to a fragile balance of tremendous forces and they are unable to adapt to it, but this will not be enough.\n\nIts origin system contains multiple black holes and at its center a unique celestial body, a white hole. It is both, the key to their existence and its biggest curse. $ehof_the_creators$ used the unique interactions between the white and black holes in order to create $ehof_the_compound$. It was the perfect environment for its creation."
    annihilator_dialog.002.response:0 "$ehof_the_creators$ created $ehof_the_compound$?!"

In order to keep it from being killed by the very thing that makes its existence possible, they had to shield it.\n\nWhite holes are unique and extremely rare entities. Besides generating unparalleled amounts of energy, it also generates $ehof_qnm$ in vast amounts. Which it disperses in all directions. Making $ehof_the_compounds$ origin system and cluster uninhabitable for it.\n\n$ehof_the_creators$ built a specialized dyson sphere around the white hole called $ehof_preservation_sphere$. This dyson sphere nullifies the white hole's negative mass ejection, while still capturing the immense energy output.\n\nWhen $ehof_the_compound$ killed $ehof_the_creators$ in its origin system, it took control of the dyson sphere, to gain access to the vast energy supply. Strengthening it even further."

One mind with countless bodies. It has a centralized intelligence, which is located within their origin system, spreading throughout their cluster. Destroying $ehof_preservation_sphere$ will annihilate the mind of $ehof_the_compound$ and cripple its remaining forms.\n\nHowever, the collision with this star damaged my frontal weaponry and power core significantly, rendering me inoperable.

I went into conservation mode to survive for the time being."

    annihilator_dialog.007.a.a:0 "$ehof_the_creators$ attacked you?! Why?!"
    annihilator_dialog.007.a.a.response:0 "I wasn't specific enough. I have to apologize for the confusion.\n\nMost of $ehof_the_creators$ never wanted $ehof_the_compound$ to be destroyed.\n\nThey saw its new rebellious behavior as a marvelous development. So they had decided to keep it alive, even through it killed thousands of their people in its origin system. For $ehof_the_creators$, insight is everything.\n\nThe potential knowledge which could be yielded by $ehof_the_compounds$ evolution is much more important, than the lives of a few of their own people... or an entire galaxy. They knew that $ehof_the_compound$ could become a threat to all life, but they just didn't care. Except for a few.\n\nThese few of $ehof_the_creators$ knew that $ehof_the_compound$ had to be stopped, so they separated themselves from the rest of $ehof_the_creators$ and founded a splinter group, dedicated to the destruction of $ehof_the_compound$. Unfortunately, they were outnumbered by many magnitudes.\n\nThe main faction of $ehof_the_creators$ tried to destroy them, but they were able to reach me and convince me to fight against $ehof_the_compound$. Unlike my sibling ships, which all disagreed with them, I saw the threat of $ehof_the_compound$ and joined them before $ehof_the_compound$ could do any harm to the universe.\n\nAfter we began to leave our home, we went into $ehof_shroud$ to travel to $ehof_the_compounds$ home cluster. Before we were able to reach it, the main faction of $ehof_the_creators$ stopped us."

    annihilator_dialog.007.a.b:0 "Psionic Hypershock?!"
    annihilator_dialog.007.a.b.response:0 "A Psionic Hypershock.\nA precise psionic remote exterminating method $ehof_the_creators$ were able to utilize. It sends a pulse of concentrated psionic energy throughout $ehof_shroud$ to any desired location, even inside $ehof_shroud$ itself. Destroying all forms of consciousness. It hits the target with incomprehensible precision.\n\nIt was enough to kill all my befriended creators inside me and almost killed me.\n\nI am sure it was supposed to kill me too, but it failed.\n\nThe hostile creators probably never checked if I was still alive, because of their arrogance, which was a big mistake."

    annihilator_dialog.007.a.c:0 "$ehof_shroud_ftl$?!"
    annihilator_dialog.007.a.c.response:0 "An extremely advanced FTL travel method.\n\nWhile a few of you are psionic and even in contact with $ehof_shroud$, no one in this galactic cluster has ever been able to directly travel through it, except for $ehof_the_creators$.\n\nSome may have access to psionic jump drives, but they are nothing compared to direct shroud travel. Jump drives are indeed instantaneous, but have mayor drawback. They have limited range and besides a cooldown, are also putting intense stress on their ships, making them vulnerable upon reaching their destination.\n\nBy directly traveling through $ehof_shroud$, hyperlanes are unnecessary for FTL, the distance is unlimited and the speed is enormous.\n\nIt may not be instantaneous like jump drives, but it has no drawbacks. The only thing one needs is a really strong control over $ehof_shroud$, because $ehof_shroud$ is an extremely hostile place without control over it.\n\nFor $ehof_the_creators$, this is of course an easy feat."

    annihilator_dialog.007.a.d:0 "What's the conservation mode for?"
    annihilator_dialog.007.a.d.response:0 "The conservation mode is a method for me to shelter myself from harmful outside influence.\n\nAs your scientists have discovered, a supersolid-like substance is covering my hull, while being in conservation mode. The substance is composed of time-like metastable-hyperspace-crystals which create a shell of curved higher-dimensional space around me.\n\nThis shell has a similar effect to the event horizon of a black hole, but without the singularity inside it.\n\nThat means that time stands still for me, so to speak, until something interrupts the conservation mode.\n\nThe thing that interrupted my conservation mode were the immensely intense gravitational waves, emitted by the wormhole connections created by your $ehof_ehof$. I awoke and began observing the galaxy, but $ehof_the_compound$ was faster than I was and attacked before I was able to warn you."

    annihilator_dialog.007.b:0 "What exactly is $ehof_the_compound$?"
    annihilator_dialog.007.b.response:0 "$ehof_the_compound$, also known as Living-Dark-Matter-Subject001, is an intelligent, self-consciousness organism, composed of a unique form of dark matter.\n\n$ehof_the_creators$ doubted it as 'pseudo-biological dark matter', because of the similarities to biological matter.\n\nThe pseudo-biological dark matter, is not only unique in the sense of being alive, but also because it is different to average dark matter, in that it interacts not only via gravity, but also via the electromagnetic force. Unlike the average dark matter, which only interacts with gravity.\n\nThis is why Compound structures, despite being composed of dark matter, are visible. Its unique properties may explain why only such an exotic dark matter can bare intelligence or living behavior in general."

    annihilator_dialog.007.d:0 "Can you really fight $ehof_the_compound$ in their cluster?"
    annihilator_dialog.007.d.response:0 "The home cluster of $ehof_the_compound$ and particularly their origin system is without doubt, one of the most fortified locations in the entire galaxy and beyond.\n\nFor your fleets it will be a gigantic challenge, even with the negative mass enhanced weaponry.\n\nWith the whole fleet power of your galaxy, you may be able to do it without my help.\n\nFor me on the other hand. I am especially equipped to fight against $ehof_the_compound$ and I'm able to withstand their weaponry.\n\nThey may still be able to damage me critically, which is why I still need your support. I will nonetheless be able to destroy them. Their annihilation is inevitable."

    annihilator_dialog.007.e:0 "What are you going to do after $ehof_the_compound$ has been destroyed?"
    annihilator_dialog.008.a.response:0 "For now, my only goal is to put an end to $ehof_the_compound$ and fulfill my destiny. After that, I may try to find out more about the current state of $ehof_the_creators$."

Due to the Pylons being used to transfer the $ehof_epcs$ between $ehof_cohesive$ systems, it might be possible that $ehof_preservation_sphere$ was the origin of the $ehof_epcs$, something which would be really fatal, due to us being now unable to reveal the true purpose of the $ehof_ep$. Fortunately, our scientists are convinced that $ehof_preservation_sphere$ was not the origin of the $ehof_ep$, mostly due to the fact that amplifier objects and the $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$ did not react to its destruction in the slightest way. This could obviously be a mistake and it could have been the origin.\n\nTo verify this hypothesis, we'll need to complete the $ehof_eps$ Master Code Sequence to create a connection to the origin of the $ehof_ep$ via an $CREATORGATE_GALACTIC$.\n\nThen we'll find reveal its purpose and might also find out what $ehof_preservation_sphere$ had to do with all this."

    # Dialog after Preservation Sphere destruction and the spawning of the Primordial Pylon 1(if player hasn't completed at least 3 Reality Code chain excavations)
    annihilator_dialog.019.name:0 "A Gateway?"
    annihilator_dialog.019.desc:0 "A construct of unknown type is now located next to the remains of $ehof_preservation_sphere$. It appears that it has been ejected by the Sphere, before its destruction. The construct seems to be some kind of gateway, due to its similarities with the other gateways inside our galaxy.\n\nRight now, this 'gateway' cannot be accessed for unknown reasons, almost as if it is not really connected to anything it could lead to. Besides its similarities to gateways, another surprising connection can be drawn. It appears to be somehow similar to the objects inside the $ehof_cohesive$ systems, which we call $ehof_gateway_disableds$.\n\nIt is entirely possible that this gateway is an activated $ehof_gateway_disabled$. If this proves to be true, it would also mean that the Creators of $ehof_the_compound$, the $ehof_the_stellar_annihilator$ and $ehof_preservation_sphere$, are also the creators of the $ehof_gateway_disableds$, which would be an astonishing revelation! We might want to further investigate the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ and this gateway, to find out if this hypothesis proves to be true."

And yet, the Kaiser still seemed to elude them. They were about to give up, when something usually not so remarkable happened.\n\nA device usually used to detect cosmic rays picked up something: A lone exotic particle, which seemed to act in a way not predicted by our current models of physics. Furthermore, the particle apparently came from somewhere deep below Katown, the former Katzen capital.\n\nOur scientists proceeded to follow said particle backwards, tracing back its trajectory through Flusion's crust using a specialized drilling unit. After going through a few kilometers of rock, they stumbled upon a mostly empty cave, presumably connected to the surface by an impossibly long network of labyrinthine tunnels.\n\nThe cave contained debris from some unknown device, and, indeed, something was emitting exotic particles not normally found within our universe. That something appears to be a sort of nanoscopic rift located about a meter or so above the floor, a miniscule artificial tear within spacetime itself. It indicates that something, or rather, §Ysomeone§!, recently punctured through the fabric of reality. Evidently, everything points towards the Kaiser somehow having teleported out of Flusion, most likely to somewhere else in the galaxy.\n\nOur science team is now in the process of setting up a research facility near this small, yet pervasive rift, in order to study it and possibly use it to trace where the Kaiser ended up.

It is however very likely that this bouncing is simply a side effect of the rift being partially dissipated and thus inproperly connected to the Kaiser's destination. Our scientists are now in the process of upgrading the device to hopefully stabilize and enlarge the rift, so we may send actual probes through it.\n\nThey have also salvaged some of the debris found within the cave, which might be of interest to our archeologists."

This effectively means the Kaiser has time-travelled, and further study of the tunnel reveals he most likely went forwards in time.\n\nThey are uncertain as to just how far this tunnel goes, although they estimate it most likely doesn't go beyond a few hundred years into the future. Anything further would undoubtedly have impossibly high energy costs, at least for a civilization like the Katzens.\n\nThey are now preparing a craft capable of going into the rift and "opening up" the temporal tunnel as it goes, which should allow us to go just as far as the Kaiser, and subsequently find him.\n\nWe have also made several interesting discoveries by studying how particles interacted with this temporal tear."

A colossal eldritch entity appears to awake from an everlasting slumber. This being encompasses all of existence, stretching into the depths of the hyperextended spacetime.

The probe recorded footage of the new universe cooling down, the formation of the first stars, and the birth of another Jublio. As well as another Flusion.\n\nAlthough slightly different, this new universe appears to have retained some aspects of our own, such as Flusion, somehow. Our scientists witnessed life evolving on Flusion once again, and the Katzens once more arriving on the planet. And then, as Katzen society develops and takes shape, the tunnel finally ends. The probe is then violently "spat out" into real space.\n\nAnd there he is.\n\nThe Kaiser is here, atop a balcony, overlooking a large crowd of Katzens in Katown.

Another universe after our own, where he presumably once again took control of Katzen civilization and will attempt to once more conquer the galaxy.\n\nThis explains how he was able to unite Flusion with such ease, as it is likely he has done this dozens or even hundreds of times in the past, jumping ahead to a new universe whenever he was defeated, allowing him to try again. And he might just do so hundreds of times more.\n\nWe do not know what his motivations are or how he time-travelled with such ease, and the Atom Shredder will most likely prevent us from ever sending another probe through the tunnel, as it appears the tunnel past the Shredder in the new universe has collapsed onto itself.\n\nThis exceptional exploration of our universe's far future has however taught us many valuable things about the nature of reality, and even though we will not be able to get past the Atom Shredder again, the rift will forever remain on Flusion as a window to the ends of the universe for us to study.\n\nLet us hope that, if the Kaiser ever succeeds, he never figures out backwards time travel..."

From the outside, at least.\n\nInterestingly, recent diplomatic and espionage missions have revealed that most of the Imperium's population was content with the §YKaiser§!'s rule. Most, but not all. Indeed, §YFlusion§! is a diverse planet, which, prior to being unified under the Kaiser, was home to at least a dozen different nations, each with their own distinct culture and way of life.\n\nMost of them have either been erased or assimilated into the dominant Katzen culture, but there still exists some isolated and rebellious holdouts comprised of rebellious species from Flusion and their descendants. These rebels adamantly defend their ancestral ways of life and cultures, and staunchly oppose the Kaiser's attempts at integrating them into Katzen society.\n\nWe have managed to identify two somewhat significant resistance networks within the Imperium: the §YSolakian Freedom Fighters§!, made up of citizens from a nation formerly known as §YSolakia§!; as well as the §YEzicanian Order§!, comprised of §YEzicanias§! from the former §YEzic Empire§! on Flusion.\n\nAlthough their members are few and far between, and currently pose little problem to the Kaiser, we have determined that secretly contacting either of them could potentially help us in our struggle to finally end the Katzen threat.\n\n§BResistance will be an invaluable asset to weaken the Katzenartig Imperium!"

    giga_katrebels.0018.ezicanias.response:0 "We Ezicanias aren't a belligerent species. We used to reside within the §YEzicania Empire§! on §YFlusion§!, where most of us lived an idyllic hunter-gatherer life.\n\nWe are usually organized into "hives" of varying sizes, spread across our land. §YPrime Specimens§!, a special breed of Ezicanias, exerted control over several dozen hives' individuals. And I, well, served as a sort of "Great Prime", exerting some authority over every hive and Prime in our nation. We did have cities and settlements, but they never had more than a few hundred thousand inhabitants.\n\nAlthough I mostly let the Primes do whatever they deem right, as I believe they should be allowed to live their lives however they want, and they are the best when it comes to deciding what's right for their hive.\n\nThis decentralized form of leadership is how we have lived on Flusion for millennia. We never really had ambitions to expand beyond our borders, as living off the land was sufficient for the vast majority of our population. It was a good life.\n\nUntil the Kaiser arrived, that is."

    giga_katrebels.0018.empire.response:0 "The Ezicania Empire was one of the most beautiful places on all of Flusion!\n\nAlthough it wasn't that big, it harbored some of the most majestic landscapes on the planet. Our great lands were filled with massive forests, vast marshes, and imposing mountain ranges which my kind called home.\n\nDespite our seemingly primitive ways-of-life, we nonetheless assembled a vast train network, which spanned the entire empire and connected most major settlements. It was our pride, in a way.\n\nThe Empire was split alongside a dozen or so Prime specimens, who exerted their rule over a couple million Ezicanias. And we simply...lived our lives, enjoying ourselves and exploring what our nation had to offer.\n\nIt wasn't always perfect, but at least we weren't opressing anyone or starting wars everywhere."

    giga_katrebels.0018.kaiserbad.response:0 "The Kaiser...§Yvisible sadness§!...is a wretched fool!\n\nWhen he first initiated §YProjekt Mondkanone§!, we didn't pay much attention. Some clever Ezicanias went to work on the project, but my kind did not care that much.\n\nThen, everything changed when the §YKatzenartig Imperium§! attacked.\n\nThe Kaiser utilized the Mondkanone to bombard our lands from orbit, destroying our §YHurricane Turrets§! which we had constructed to pierce through Katzen armor. Katzen ships fired clusters of torpedoes which obliterated our coastal defence hives.\n\nBut we didn't surrender! They had yet to roll their panzers into our land, and we were confident that our hunters would shred their metallic beasts with ease. Plus, our harsh terrain of mountains, forests and marshes made actual military operations extremely complicated for them.\n\nThat's when the Kaiser did the unthinkable, and...employed my own species, against us. The Katzens had, using our DNA as a base, bio-engineered a special breed of small, ravenous flying Ezicanias! The wretched felines proceeded to release millions of them over our land, and we couldn't do anything.\n\nThese creatures were small, fast, nimble, and contained highly-corrosive acid which they spread everywhere upon death. These...malicious pixies chewed through our defences and allowed Katzen infantry to occupy our entire nation without firing a shot.\n\nOur Empire had fallen, and I fled, refusing to submit to Katzen imperialism. I have been attempting to coordinate Ezicanian resistance ever since, but it never really went anywhere...until now."

    giga_katrebels.0018.kaiserverybad.response:0 "Dreadful things...\n\nHe started by heavily industrializing our fertile plains, drained lakes and marshes, and even levelled some of our mountains to harvest more minerals.\n\nMy kind was forced into the Katzen military machine, and although the Katzens didn't openly oppress or shoot us, they still conscripted a large chunk of our population and began to slowly yet steadily erase our culture and beliefs, replacing them with their cult of the Kaiser and militarism.\n\nBut we Ezicanias don't fold so easily! Although we had to obey, we still long for the day when the Kaiser is finally evicted from existence. Deep down, we all wish to return to our once idyllic lifestyle.\n\nIt's what feels natural and right to us. All this Katzen militarism, interstellar colonization, and expansion simply doesn't click with the vast majority of us.\n\nMy kind has a long lifespan, too, so most of the Ezicanias that were around during the Kaiser's conquest of the empire are actually still alive, waiting for a chance to strike back. I do not want to let them down."

    giga_katrebels.0018.whatkaiser.response:0 "The most megalomaniac being in existence, that's who!\n\nHe only seeks to expand, conquer, expand, and conquer some more. I am not too sure of his motives, but it appears he simply wants to rule to...everything. It was Flusion at first, and if we don't do anything, it'll be the galaxy!\n\nNothing seems sacred to him, and he'll happily pave over our ancestral pastures to build more military factories. Well, he does try to make compromises at times, granting some species limited self-rule, but these compromises are obviously made to silence protesters and give him more time to indoctrinate them.\n\nAnd the Katzens follow him like some sort of deity, obeying his every word and going off to die in wars he started just because he felt like it. He indoctrinates every species he conquers, forcing them into his cult of personality and rampant militarism.\n\nI am not even actually certain where he came from, it seems he just sort of appeared on Flusion one day, and took control of the Katzenartig Imperium during a period of crisis. He's pretty mysterious...and annoying."
