The two volumes are separated by possessing distinct vacuum energy densities.\n\nThe outer volume has a vacuum energy density virtually identical to that of the outside universe and is filled with hundreds of stars. Countless technological entities are located within the outer volume that appear to harness the energy of the stars, the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum energy and even extra-dimensional energies of an unknown origin.\n\nThe inner volume appears to be an empty void, filled purely with antiparticle-particle pairs from quantum fluctuations. However, it possesses a much larger vacuum energy density than the outer volume.\n\nOur conclusion gives rise to the assumption that the reason for the segregation of the volume into the two distinct ones is to generate ridiculously large amounts of energy! All the energy gets extracted within the outer volume and then siphoned into the inner volume. The energy content of the inner volume was determined to be at least 10^49 Joule, which is equivalent to the total mass-energy of a thousand stars.\n\nFurthermore, we were able to determine that the amplifiers and primordial pylons work in unison as energy and information distributors, which are scattered all throughout the galaxy. They are used to create a gigantic energy and information distribution network and are supposed to utilize the energy provided by $ehof_the_sphere$ to create quasi-negative mass. The amplifiers are repeaters of the enigmatic pattern, the sentient administration protocol of the galactic distribution network and generators for quasi-negative mass.\n\nThe primordial pylons are used to distribute the orders of the $ehof_the_sphere$ around the network and transmit information between amplifiers and $ehof_the_sphere$. This means that there are many more $ehof_cohesive$ systems in the galaxy, than we preciously anticipated!\n\nUnfortunately, we were still not able to determine what the initial purpose for this gigantic construct and the network is, but the most astonishing revelation is that $ehof_the_sphere$ is not the only construct of its type and there are at least a few more located somewhere outside of our galaxy.\n\nWhatever it is that the creators of these enormous constructs wanted to achieve, it needed more energy than thousands of stars could generate in their entire lifetime!

The location itself is already really strange.\n\nAfter reaching a proximity of about 300 meters to the location of the source, the crust material suddenly ended and they reached a hollow space inside the crust. Inside this space a construct that appears to be the source, is located. It is shaped in the form of an octahedron, with a diameter of exactly 2.5 kilometers at it's biggest extent.\n\nThe entire space around the object appears to be wobbling for unknown reasons, as if the object is projecting some sort of force field.

Thermal scans reveal an astonishing property of the object. Its thermal temperature is at almost absolute zero, in the orders of zeptokelvin, colder than black holes. At such a low temperature, the state of an object can almost be seen as frozen in time. How the construct can reach this temperature and for what reason is unknown.

And it did.\n\nOn one of the surfaces of the object, an entrance manifested.

Inside, they found a hyper-complex technological system.\n\nAfter an intense study of the system, they were able to determine the initial function of the structure. It is not the source of the $ehof_ep$, but serves as an amplifier and repeater for it. The sequence appears to get transmitted via gravielectromagnetic waves to the edge of the solar system, where it, through an unknown mechanism, enters some form of faster-than-light travel.\n\nIt might be possible that the alien object, which is located at the edge of this solar system, the $ehof_gateway_disabled$, might have something to do with it.\n\nA distinct code sequence fragment of the $ehof_ep$, that appears to be compatible with the original code sequence that was discovered long ago, has been extracted from the amplifier object by the crew. Besides this, they've also made an astonishing discovery in regards to the composition of the amplifier object.\n\nTests on the inner composition of the object revealed that it is made of an unique, self-replicating and self-regenerating substance, similar to Living Metal. The crew was not able to determine what the substance is composed of, due to the lack of the necessary equipment, but it may possess a large scientific potential.

Three things are necessary for the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ to react to the transmission of the $ehof_epcs$ and activate, to transport it throughout interstellar space.\n\nFirst, the gravielectromagnetic waves, which transport the $ehof_epcs$ sequence, need to possess a specific energy content. If the energy content differs even slightly, regardless if it is less or higher, the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ will not react to the transmission and neutralize the gravielectromagnetic wave. Second, the kind of wave, which transports the $ehof_epcs$ sequence, needs to be gravielectromagnetic.\n\nThe reason for this appears to be that the $ehof_gateway_disableds$ won't get activated by other forms of radiation, with the same energy content necessary to activate the $ehof_gateway_disableds$. Third, the enigmatic pattern code sequence needs to be tuned perfectly to activate the $ehof_gateway_disabled$.\n\nThis serves as a way to ensure that the $ehof_gateway_disabled$ is only getting activated when truly needed and not accidentally.

When using the fragments in unison, they align themselves autonomously into a specific order, frequency and amplitude. It appears that these fragments are part of a specific and unique manifestation of the $ehof_epcs$ sequence. It is distinct from all the others, which are used simply for activating the $ehof_gateway_disableds$, turning them into $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$ and transporting the $ehof_epcs$ between $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$. For now, this unique manifestation seems to be without use for us, cause it is not entirely whole yet. Based on computational analysis, at least one or two more specific fragments are needed, for the completion of the sequence. Its purpose is currently unknown.\n\nOther than an additional fragment of the unique $ehof_epcs$, we've also found out even more about $ehof_sm$. As we already know, $ehof_sm$ is composed of an array of nano-machines, with an inherent A.I. routine, which analyses the environment and tells the $ehof_sm$ which action to execute, in order to adapt to environmental effects.\n\nWhat we didn't knew is how the orders get distributed throughout the substance, as it is apparently able to react to environmental effects everywhere in the substance simultaneously, even when the effect only gets applied at one location. We now know that the nanite particles, the substance is composed of, are connected through an astonishingly advanced and complex network, with each nanite serving as neurons, eyes and hands, effectively making it a hive mind.\n\nEach nanite perceives the environmental information and instantly distributes it over the whole substance for the inherent A.I. routine to process it with the help of each nanite as processors. They then all get the orders from the routine at once, explaining the extremely fast adaptation mechanism of $ehof_sm$. The hive mind of the $ehof_sm$ is so advanced, that its computational capacity dwarfs even our largest quantum-computer networks and gives rise to the hypothesis, that it might not only be sentient, but even self-aware.\n\nNonetheless, with this new knowledge about $ehof_sm$, we might be able to use the $ehof_sm$ Hive Mind's extreme computational capacity, to create systems which are controlled by the $ehof_sm$ Hive Mind. Weapons, ships and structures being controlled by the hyper-complex $ehof_sm$ Hive Mind, would be able to react and adapt much faster than anything else we have and probably will ever have.\n\nWith all this newly acquired knowledge in mind, the crew of the drilling unit is ready to head back to the surface of the planet."

What we already know is the following. The amplifiers are capable of creating quasi-negative mass for an unknown purpose and are using the $CREATORGATE_GALACTICSS$ to communicate with each other.

The spherical object which is probably the origin of the enigmatic pattern.\n\nVisual and thermal scans of the surface show that it's perpetually in motion and changing between many different states of matter. It is neither solid nor liquid nor gaseous nor a plasma. It is all of them at once! Even ultra high or ultra low energy states of matter appear to exist within the surface's composition, like Bose-Einstein-Condensates, degenerate matter and even photonic matter.\n\nThe surface is also glowing on its own from time to time, at different locations, probably because of the decay of photonic matter and the constant phase transitions. Based on our knowledge about $ehof_sm$ and the fact that all the other primordial structures are made of it, it is likely that the surface is made out of the same material. Attempts to verify this hypothesis unfortunately prove futile, as the composition of the surface is impossible to determine with scanners, due to the constant and extremely rapid phase transitions. What's noteworthy is that it appears to possess specific colour schemes, that are the same almost all over construct. A gold-silver and orange. How all of this works is absolutely unknown.\n\nTwo circular shaped areas, which can only be defined as the 'poles' of this sphere, because perfect spheres don't have poles, are distinct from the main surface structure. They have a diameter of approximately 2 million kilometers and appear to be made out of a solid, crystalline material with a bronze-like colour. Unlike the rest of the surface, the poles are static and don't change in the slightest way. In the centers of these poles, some kind of large sigil, shaped in a similar form as the amplifiers and the sigils on the $ehof_gateway_disableds$, is located. It may be some sort of representative symbol of the creators of this construct, the amplifiers and the $CREATORGATE_GALACTICSS$.\n\nJust like with the amplifier objects, the surface cannot be penetrated with scanners, but unlike them its temperature is not definable, due to the perpetually changing phases of the surface.\n\nAn entrance is not identifiable, if there is any, but it may be similar to the amplifier objects, whose entrances only 'manifest' under specific conditions.\n\nAn intense study of the structure will be necessary to determine its function and to find a way into it, which will probably be necessary to determine the function in the first place.

The size of the notches themselves did not change.\n\nWith this rate of increase, it will take 126 facilities in total until the amount of notches and their alignment would cover the whole pole. Building an additional 110 of these expensive facilities would be an economical nightmare and our scientists are convinced that increasing the number until the whole pole is covered, would not lead to the manifestation of an entrance.

It is composed of an array of hyper-advanced nano-machines, which are able to replicate themselves and together, can mimic many different forms of matter, and physical and chemical properties.\n\nThe way the substance behaves, makes it almost appear that the substance is not only alive, but even sentient. It is able to react to numerous different environmental conditions, with all its reactions being dedicated to adapting to the condition and ensuring the integrity of itself. Different forms of reactions have been observed.\n\nReplication, rearrangement and reshaping, in order to make the substance immune against any kind of damaging physical or chemical effect. Extreme heat, cold and corrosiveness, intense electromagnetic fields, different forms of radiation, mechanical pressure, lasers, even gravity. There seems to be no upper limit to the efficiency of its adaptive abilities, at least none we are able to determine.\n\nOther than its ability to transform and multiply to preserve itself, the structure is also capable of 'growing'. Its replicative abilities come in two different forms. The first form of replication appears when the substance needs to adapt to damaging environmental effects, at which it appears to be able to replicate itself out of nothing, perhaps by absorbing the energy or matter of the damaging effects itself, or by using an undetectable energy source.\n\nIn this case, the substance doesn't or only insignificantly increases its volume. The second form of replication appears, when the substance has adapted to any damaging effects and is in contact or close proximity to available matter or energy. It absorbs these to increase its volume, to 'grow', and can apparently absorb almost any known form of matter and energy.\n\nOnly gravitational energy, Dark Matter and Quasi-Negative Mass could not be absorbed. What the purpose of this 'growth' is, is unknown, but based on the reports about the amplifier, it didn't happen inside the amplifier itself, even though our crew and their tools were in direct contact to the substance. It appears that the substance is capable of being 'aware' about its environment and depending on the circumstances, react differently.\n\nOur scientists decided to name the substance '$ehof_sm$', as an analogy to Living Metal, due to its similarities. Even though we still know almost nothing about the substance or rather how it works, our scientific community is convinced that it possesses an unimaginable technological potential and they want to intensify our research on the substance and also the amplifiers. Not only to find out more about the enigmatic pattern, but also about the $ehof_sm$.\n\nThe uses for $ehof_sm$ may be limited for now, as we still know too few about it, to utilize it to its fullest extent, but our scientists developed designs for the construction of specialized facilities, dedicated to the reproduction of $ehof_sm$, by feeding it minerals and energy. Additionally, a project to investigate an Primordial Stones has been requested, as our scientists believe that they may have been constructed by the same entities that built the amplifiers, and could thus also be composed of $ehof_sm$."

    ehof_cause:0 "§HCause§!\nDue to the uncertainty principle, in every fraction of a second, quantum fluctuations of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs occur countless times everywhere in space. These fluctuations stimulate tiny volumes of space and create the microcosmic structure of space known as quantum foam. Virtual micro black holes which only exist for an immensely short period of time can emerge in this quantum foam. These black holes can turn into real $ehof_wormhole$ via quantum tunneling and the lifetime is much longer than that of the micro black holes, but still extremely short and can potentially be inflated for space travel. However the number of occurrences is too small in average space."

    ehof_effect:0 "§HEffect§!\nThe highest density of quantum fluctuations can be found at the event horizon of a black hole where the already enormously twisted space is filled with more virtual particles, due to the hawking radiation that is responsible for the decay of black holes. The quantum foam structure of space is so intensely stimulated in these volumes, that the number of emerging micro black holes is many magnitudes larger than in average space and thus the number of $ehof_wormholes$ which can be inflated."

The fields serve as enormous immaterial tweezers for the inflation process and also keep the $ehof_wormholes$ open.\n\nIn order to increase the stability of the $ehof_wormholes$, the $ehof_ehofp2$ is equipped with negative pressure application plates, which apply negative pressure to the event horizon while a $ehof_wormhole$ is being inflated. This cools down the local space around the black hole, reducing the number of quantum fluctuations and as a consequence the quantum tunneling effects.

Gravitational projectors and dampers are added to the $ehof_wormholes$ inflation mechanism and combined with the squeezed, condensed electromagnetic field projectors. This allows the creation of gravitational-electromagnetic quasi-fields, which create a repulsive force that can be used to inflate the $ehof_wormholes$.\n\n$ehof_darkmatter$ combined with negative pressure, create $ehof_qnm$, which can further stabilize inflated $ehof_wormholes$. For this reason, Dark Matter injectors have been integrated into the $ehof_ehofp3$ to inject Dark Matter into the event horizon.\n\nMore negative pressure can be applied which cools down the local space around the black hole even further and produces $ehof_qnm$.\n\nThe $ehof_ehofp3$ is the most efficient a facility could be and increasing the efficiency of the $ehof_ehof$ would be almost impossible, as such probabilistic target routines for the $ehof_ehofp3$ targeting mechanisms include:\n  - §ERandomized Destinations§!\n  - $ehof_category_01$\n  - $ehof_category_02$\n  - $ehof_category_03$\n  - $ehof_category_04$\n  - $ehof_category_05$\n  - $ehof_category_06$\n  - $ehof_category_07$"

This allows us to increase or decrease the vacuum energy density in a limited volume, which determines not only the way matter and energy behaves, but also the quantum fluctuations and quantum tunneling.\n\nThe $ehof_ehofp4$ is truly the perfect form of the $ehof_ehof$ and the pinnacle of interstellar travel!"

    giga_dialog.3001.desc:0 "In the [from.GetName] system lies a strange construct. Our scientists are baffled at the sight of this massive orbital installation circling the system's star. In fact, it is so ridiculous that it was assumed to be a prank, or an anomaly in our sensors.\n\nA $name_ringworld_square$.\n\nWithin the [from.GetName] system lies a square-shaped ringworld. While it appears to have sustained quite a lot of punishment in the past, it still seems to be mostly structurally intact. This construct's odd shape defies everything we know about physics and engineering, as gravity should have snapped this thing apart millennia ago. Yet, here it idly stands, waiting for something to uncover its mysteries.\n\nA small and mostly derelict station also floats silently above the star, and our scientists believe it might contain useful information about this peculiar structure.\n\nA §SSpecial Project§! has been issued to investigate this thing and the station in an effort to figure out how it even still exists."

Its frame is mostly made out of Quberine, an extremely advanced alloy packed with incredibly complex self-repairing electronics, thus explaining how it is able to withstand the incredible forces exerted on it.\n\nOur scientists believe it might be possible to repair this thing, given enough resources and sufficiently advanced technologies. We have detected a number of deactivated Quberine-manufacturing plants within the ringworld, which might start producing Quberine again if we restore this ringworlds power supply during future repairs.\n\nThe research teams have also concluded that the small station above the star serves as a sort of 'central access point' to the Squareworld's internal systems. They encourage us to spend some energy credits and alloys to repair and subsequently re-activate it, as it might grant us to access invaluable data about the Squareworld and its builders stored within its vast internal archives. Said data might very well be the key to repairing this wonderful construct..."

Our research teams have managed to establish contact with it, and it is quite eager to communicate with us."

It's been a while since I've talked to a sapient entity.\n\nI am Garyx, the artificial intelligence responsible for maintaining the Squareworld and its vast data archives, and I have taken the form of a holographic reptilian, as this is what my makers looked like.\n\nAnyways, apologies for the sorry state of the Squareworld. I found a particularly interesting documentary about reptilian reproduction, and I've been studying it for the past 120 millennia using backup power in order to better understand my makers. Unfortunately, it seems that something drastic happened to the Squareworld in the meantime...Oh well.\n\nNow that you're here, and since my makers are apparently long gone, you can have permission to access the Squareworld's databanks, which are surprisingly mostly intact."

    giga_dialog.3005.a:0 "What's in those databanks?"
    giga_dialog.3005.a.response:0 "Oh, many things. My makers stored plenty of data about the various empires and species they knew about, their scientific knowledge, and most importantly, their deity §BQubey§!.\nThey wanted to preserve it so future generations could benefit from it, and, well, since you're here now, I guess they succeeded in this task. Too bad they're not here to see it anymore..."

    giga_dialog.3005.b:0 "How old is the Squareworld?"
    giga_dialog.3005.b.response:0 "Well, judging from the position of the stars, I estimate that this thing's been broken for about 120 000 of your years, but it is much older than that.\nIt was built about 567 000 years ago by my makers, and housed their civilization for many millennia. I'm not sure what happened to it, as I was unfortunately completely captivated by my research. The most likely possibility is that their civilization collapsed from decadence or simply grew too old and divergent, just like many other great empires before them."

    giga_dialog.3005.c:0 "Who built the Squareworld, and why?"
    giga_dialog.3005.c.response:0 "My makers did. They were a species of §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!, known as the §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!, and they ruled over a rather large empire, the §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!\n\nThey were incredibly religious too, and worshipped a deity they called §BQubey§!. This deity was said to have helped their species evolve over million of years, and many saw the perfection of geometrical shapes as §BQubey§!'s way to manifest his presence to the world.\n\nMy makers eventually discovered an incredible substance, possessing unrivaled self-repairing properties. They dubbed it 'Quberine', as they believed the substance was made out of §BQubey§! himself, and decided to use it to construct this magnificent physics-defying geometrical structure as a way to both worship and show their gratitude towards §BQubey§!\n\nThey also took the opportunity to pack as much data about their scientific advancements, Quberine, the Squareworld, and §BQubey§!, into the databanks, in hopes that a future civilization stumbling upon it may learn of the almighty §BQubey§! as well."

    giga_dialog.3005.d:0 "Can we somehow repair the Squareworld?"
    giga_dialog.3005.d.response:0 "Hopefully yes! The mostly-functional archives contain a lot of data about the Squareworld's internal and external structure. If you give me a few dozen months to compile it all, I can give your scientists a data cache containing all the necessary information to conduct extensive repairs on the megastructure. I'd love to see the Squareworld restored to its former glory!"

However, the Katzens only possessed limited FTL, and very few colonies outside their home system, which made the project tremendously expensive to their civilization. Although the terraforming structure was remarkably well-made, its sheer cost led to an economic collapse. Because of this, the Sobakis of Nienet, a civilization which shared the Gatzo system and were once close allies to the Katzens, decided to strike at Katzenland, in an attempt to conquer it while it was weakened, contradicting our original theory that the Katzens struck first.\n\nMeopa then retaliated with the 'fury of a thousand suns', completely and utterly devastating Nienet's surface. This disproportionate genocidal response led to a drastic drop in the nation's stability, which culminated with empire-wide revolts against Meopa's regime. Meopa, unwilling to step down, and his sanity rapidly deteriorating, proceeded to do the unthinkable:\nHe unleashed the rest of Katzen nuclear arsenal...upon Katzenland itself. He destroyed his own world, killing billions of Katzens and Ezicania. The relatively small Katzen space empire then collapsed, with the few colonies unable to sustain themselves without their capital.\n\nAlthough, the records spoke of a large colonization vessel labelled the §YMeopian Expedition 1§!, launched prior to the Sobaki-Katzen war towards an unknown faraway planet, which carried both Katzens and Ezicanias in cryosleep, meaning there is a slim chance the species are still out there, somewhere.\n\nOn the bright side, we have managed to recover surprisingly intact and detailed schematics of Projekt Katzenform, which will undoubtedly benefit our knowledge of terraforming."

They report that the $ehof_trader_new_system$ system is inhabited by an advanced civilization, is filled with numerous space stations and ships are traversing through it, which seem to be civilian only.\n\nThe system appears to be heavily terraformed and astro-engineered, because almost all of the planets in the system are covered in gigantic, city-like structures and the planetary orbits are too perfect to be natural.\n\n§H[root.GetName]§! is receiving transmissions from all over the system. It appears the inhabitants want to talk to us."
    ehof_mega_trader.002.a:0 "Interesting"

    ehof_mega_trader.003.desc:0 "Greetings, §H[root.owner.GetSpeciesClassPlural]§! from the beyond. Welcome to our glorious utopia and home, $ehof_trader_new_system$.\n\nWe are the $ehof_trader$ and our intentions are peaceful. It may appear rude to you that we don't introduce ourselves further, or let you introduce yourselves first, but the situation is urgent.\n\nWe must ask you if you possess an extremely rare resource, which is essential for the survival of our civilization.\n\nDo you possess $ehof_alt_qnm$?"
    ehof_mega_trader.003.a:0 "What is $ehof_alt_qnm$?"

    ehof_mega_trader.004.desc:0 "$ehof_alt_qnm$ is a unique and unimaginably rare form of matter, which possesses properties like no other.\n\nIt has a negative gravitational charge, a negative mass, and is able to negatively warp spacetime.\n\nThis unique property is what allows us to stabilize $ehof_trader_dt$.\n\nWe're happy to tell you more about it, if you possess $ehof_alt_qnm$ and would be ready to share some of it with us. There would be a reward for your kindness!"
    ehof_mega_trader.004.a:0 "This sounds similar to $ehof_qnm$"

    ehof_mega_trader.005.desc:0 "So you know about $ehof_alt_qnm$?\n\nIf you have $ehof_qnm$ you could trade, we would reward you a great treasure from beyond $ehof_trader_dt$, which may be very useful to you.\n\nWe could even show you the pathway to some of the extraordinary solar systems, which were located while mapping the stars with the gifts granted to us by $ehof_trader_d$.\n\nWill you help us, §H[root.owner.GetSpeciesClassPlural]§! from the beyond?"
    ehof_mega_trader.005.a:0 "You've got yourselves a deal"

    ehof_mega_trader.006.desc:0 "Salutations, §H[root.owner.GetSpeciesClassPlural]§! from the beyond\nThough you're most welcome to stay as long as you like, we need time to replenish our stock and as such you will need to wait §H£time£5 Years§! before we can offer you different goods.\n\nDo you have some $ehof_qnm$ you would like to trade?"

    ehof_mega_trader.006.c:0 "$ehof_trader_new_system$ has so many wormholes..."
    ehof_mega_trader.006.c.response:0 "Wormholes are our primary form of interstellar travel. We're capable of generating both permanent and temporary connections, much like the ones you are able to create.\n\nWe have yet to discover any other means of interstellar travel and though you may be tempted to offer us other methods of interstellar travel, we would prefer to discover them in our own time, should the need arise.\n\nIn order to open a wormhole between $ehof_trader_new_system$ and the target system, we have to travel to the target system and build a wormhole constructor to create a psionic link between the two systems. Then we open a wormhole, by aligning the wormhole constructors through the psionic link and use a tremendous amount of psionic energy to rip open the wormhole simultaneously in both systems.\n\nThrough the use of $ehof_qnm$, we can stabilize the systems indefinitely. The wormholes will then be linked and traversable. This is why we need $ehof_qnm$, without it the wormholes would only be temporary and would collapse shortly after being opened. We only open wormholes from $ehof_trader_new_system$ to the others, because it is our central hub, our home, and the amount of $ehof_qnm$ we possess to open wormholes is limited. Or at least it was until we happened across you.\n\nIt is possible for us to create temporary wormholes in order to travel to other systems without a wormhole constructor, but doing so takes more energy, with no means of returning any extracted resources. This is not beneficial to $ehof_trader_new_system$ and our dream of building a utopia of never before seen magnitudes. It has been a goal we set to achieve a millennia ago, after the great war and the events inside our original home system, $ehof_trader_old_system$.\n\nHowever, with your technology, these systems would be beneficial to you and you would be free to do with them whatever you desire."

    ehof_mega_trader.006.d:0 "What do you know about $ehof_qnm$?"
    ehof_mega_trader.006.d.response:0 "Though we discovered $ehof_qnm$ long ago, we have yet to unveil all of its secrets. What we do know is that it cannot be, or at least extremely unlikely to emerge naturally.\n\nIts properties appear to violate multiple fundamental laws of physics. For example, the stress component of the stress-energy tensor is larger than the mass density of the space in which it is located, which should be impossible.\n\n$ehof_qnm$ is not like the pseudo-negative mass like properties of the negative energy density of the vacuum, which fuel the cosmic expanse. It is a true form of negative mass, which could not have occurred within the passed lifetime of the universe.\n\nThe fact that you have $ehof_qnm$ in larger magnitudes than we were ever able to gather from $ehof_trader_dt$, without creating it yourself, means it was either created in an extremely unlikely event, or it was in fact created by advanced beings, capable of its creation. We believe the latter to be true."

    ehof_mega_trader.007.desc:0 "What would you like to know?"
    ehof_mega_trader.007.a:0 "Who are you?"
    ehof_mega_trader.007.a.response:0 "We are the $ehof_trader$, an egalitarian society of techno-organic lifeforms, gifted with psionic abilities by $ehof_trader_d$.\n\nOur goal is to make $ehof_trader_new_system$, our central solar system, into an astonishing utopia of unseen magnitudes.\n\nWe live in harmony with $ehof_trader_d$, who are guiding us and helping us to achieve this ultimate goal, while we grow together and evolve peacefully and mindfully."

    ehof_mega_trader.007.b:0 "What is your history?"
    ehof_mega_trader.007.b.response:0 "Our central hub, $ehof_trader_new_system$ is connected to $ehof_trader_old_system$, our original home system. You may have noticed, the whole system is devastated and filled with the remains of numerous ships and constructs. These are the remains of the fleets, habitats and structures of our organic forerunners.\n\nMillennia ago, when they were still planet-bound, $ehof_trader_dt$ was already in $ehof_trader_old_system$. It is unknown how long it has existed there, but it is at least as old as our history. When they first witnessed the existence of $ehof_trader_d$, they set their focus on reaching it. Even though it took them centuries until they were able to leave their home world, their focus never wavered. Reaching $ehof_trader_dt$ was their main goal. $ehof_trader_t$ appeared to be some kind of planet, in reality, it is a gate, a portal to an extra-dimensional realm, $ehof_trader_realm$.\n\nWhen they first physically entered $ehof_trader_realm$, they came into contact with the entity. It was kind and considerate, teaching them about the wonders of the inter-dimensional reality, that watches and dreams, $ehof_shroud$. They began to live in harmony with $ehof_trader_d$ and were guided by it, to achieve a higher state of society and being. It is the reason we have psionic abilities, which manifested shortly after the first contact with $ehof_trader_d$. Their civilization developed into a glorious, stellar empire, $ehof_trader_dominion$. All worlds of $ehof_trader_old_system$ were colonized and the empire was centered around $ehof_trader_dt$.\n\nUnfortunately, this astonishing expansion and development was not ever-lasting. The maximum capacity of $ehof_trader_old_system$ was reached, and without additional worlds, the resources would soon be depleted and the great stellar empire would perish. The only logical consequence was extra-stellar expansion. Faster than light travel technologies had not been developed yet and sending countless people with generation ships and resources to a neighboring system, in order to terraform it into a suitable one, was no option.\n\n$ehof_trader_dominion$ decided to develop a form of machine intelligences, which would be able to traverse the gap between $ehof_trader_old_system$ and the most suitable system, $ehof_trader_new_system$, to terraform it for the empire. These were the forerunners of the machines, $ehof_trader_machines$."

    ehof_mega_trader.007.continue:0 "Continue"

    ehof_mega_trader.007.b.response.b:0 "Many years had passed since the terraforming machines had originally been sent to $ehof_trader_new_system$. They terraformed $ehof_trader_new_system$ into a suitable system for the people of $ehof_trader_dominion$. Surprisingly, the system was not the only thing that changed. The flow of time began to change the machines and they became self-aware, thinking machines that grew to love $ehof_trader_new_system$ and wanted it for their own, a development which was not tolerable for $ehof_trader_dominion$. Extrasolar expansion was the only option and now there was a terraformed, suitable system, not far away, ready to be colonized and now their very own creations, made especially for that purpose, choose to keep the system for themselves. This lead to tensions between $ehof_trader_dominion$ and $ehof_trader_machines$, which would lead to a vast conflict, we refer to as, the Great War.\n\n$ehof_trader_dominion$ and the $ehof_trader_machines$ waged war and fought over the possession of $ehof_trader_new_system$. The biggest problem for both parties was that their strength were evenly matched, no side could really win the war. $ehof_trader_dominion$s psionic supremacy versus the technological-mechanical genius of $ehof_trader_machines$. If the war would have continued the way it was, it would have led to the extinction of both, $ehof_trader_dominion$ and $ehof_trader_machines$. An event $ehof_trader_d$ saw as likely. In order to prevent the extinction of all intelligent life in the systems, $ehof_trader_d$ proposed a solution which would not only end the war, but also solve the problems between $ehof_trader_dominion$ and $ehof_trader_machines$, The Amalgamation.\n\nThe Amalgamation, the unification of the organic people of $ehof_trader_dominion$ and the mechanical Excognitor, would bring birth to a new, ascended kind of beings, The $ehof_trader$, us, having the strength and wisdom of both kinds, without any of the flaws.\n\nAfter the Amalgamation was carried out and our people were born, we made it our goal to create a perfect utopia in $ehof_trader_new_system$, the system our forerunners fought for, and have since left $ehof_trader_old_system$ as a monument to the sins of those who came before us."

    ehof_mega_trader.007.c:0 "What is $ehof_trader_d$ and $ehof_trader_t$?"
    ehof_mega_trader.007.c.response:0 "$ehof_trader_d$ is an immaterial entity, which inhabits $ehof_trader_realm$. It has yet to be revealed, if $ehof_trader_d$ inhabits its realm and is a separate entity, or if it is the realm itself.\n\n$ehof_trader_realm$ is a part of the multiverse's, inter-dimensional fabric of $ehof_shroud$.\n\n$ehof_shroud$ has countless entities, of which $ehof_trader_d$ is a youngling of, which was born long ago, when $ehof_trader_dt$ originally emerged. This created both, the permanent connection to $ehof_shroud$ and $ehof_trader_realm$ itself, and in turn $ehof_trader_d$.\n\nWhen $ehof_trader_dt$ was created is unknown, but it was probably before our organic forerunners emerged on their home world. $ehof_qnm$ is what keeps $ehof_trader_dt$ open, but it is also what allows us to open the wormholes to other systems and keep them open.\n\nUnfortunately, we need to extract the $ehof_qnm$ from $ehof_trader_dt$, to use it for our wormholes. With $ehof_qnm$ being a limited resource, this would one day either mean, that we cannot construct any additional wormholes anymore and permanently halt our expansion, or it would lead to the collapse of $ehof_trader_dt$ and cut our connection to $ehof_trader_d$, which would lead to the loss of our psionic abilities and $ehof_trader_d$ guidance. Both of these events could or would lead to the collapse of our civilization, which is why we need your $ehof_qnm$ to keep expanding and stabilize $ehof_trader_dt$."

    compound_dialog.1.desc:0 "A short time ago, we discovered a cluster of black holes. This is very unusual, as such we begun the process of triangulating the exact coordinates in order to potentially travel there, or at least observe from afar.\n\nDays after the initial sighting of the black hole cluster, our scientists noticed one of furthest star systems from our galaxy appeared to have a dyson sphere of some kind and as such it was concluded that this system has life. In the following days, it had become of utmost importance to learn more of this cluster and life it harboured.\n\nToday is the day we have learned about the life in question. Upon furthur investigation of the closest black hole, we discovered a large structure encompassing a large portion of the black hole, much like an $ehof_ehof$. And much like an $ehof_ehof$, it appears to work in a similar manor, creating wormholes to very distance stars.\n\nThe lifeforms that were previously discovered have opened a wormhole to the §Y[compound_invasion_entry.GetName]§! system. They destroyed everything in the entire system within an instant, these creatures have not come in peace."

    annihilator_dialog.001.desc:0 "Greetings inhabitants of Galaxy-XY1527, I am a $NAME_Stellar_Annihilator_Species$, also refereed to as $ehof_the_stellar_annihilator$. I have been sent by $ehof_the_creators$ to destroy the Living-Dark-Matter-Subject001, $ehof_the_compound$.\n\nAs you've probably already noticed, its motivations are total cosmic transmutation. Beginning with your home galaxy.\n\n$ehof_the_compound$ believes itself to be invincible. I've monitored its actions and to a certain degree, this is true. However it is ignorant to its biggest weakness. A fundamental flaw that is part of its very nature. All forms of dark matter will disintegrate when in contact with $ehof_qnm$. This is its eternal weakness."
    annihilator_dialog.001.response:0 "So $ehof_qnm$ is the key?"

    annihilator_dialog.002.desc:0 "With negative mass enhanced weapons, or weapons that use negative mass directly, $ehof_the_compound$ can be destroyed. Its very existence is only possible, due to a fragile balance of tremendous forces and they are unable to adapt to it, but this will not be enough.\n\nIts origin system contains multiple black holes and at its center a unique celestial body, a white hole. It is both, the key to their existence and its biggest curse. $ehof_the_creators$ used the unique interactions between the white and black holes in order to create $ehof_the_compound$. It was the perfect environment for its creation."
    annihilator_dialog.002.response:0 "$ehof_the_creators$ created $ehof_the_compound$?!"

    annihilator_dialog.003.desc:0 "They created $ehof_the_compound$ millions of years ago, as the first dark matter lifeform in this galactic cluster. In order to keep it from being killed by the very thing that makes its existence possible, they had to shield it.\n\nWhite holes are unique and extremely rare entities. Besides generating unparalleled amounts of energy, it also generates $ehof_qnm$ in vast amounts. Which it disperses in all directions. Making $ehof_the_compounds$ origin system and cluster uninhabitable for it.\n\n$ehof_the_creators$ built a specialized dyson sphere around the white hole called $ehof_preservation_sphere$. This dyson sphere nullifies the white hole's negative mass ejection, while still capturing the immense energy output.\n\nWhen $ehof_the_compound$ killed $ehof_the_creators$ in its origin system, it took control of the dyson sphere, to gain access to the vast energy supply. Strengthening it even further."

One mind with countless bodies. It has a centralized intelligence, which is located within their origin system, spreading throughout their cluster. Destroying $ehof_preservation_sphere$ will annihilate the mind of $ehof_the_compound$ and cripple its remaining forms.\n\nHowever, the collision with this star damaged my frontal weaponry and power core significantly, rendering me inoperable.

I went into conservation mode to survive for the time being."

    annihilator_dialog.007.a.a:0 "$ehof_the_creators$ attacked you?! Why?!"
    annihilator_dialog.007.a.a.response:0 "I wasn't specific enough. I have to apologize for the confusion.\n\nMost of $ehof_the_creators$ never wanted $ehof_the_compound$ to be destroyed.\n\nThey saw its new rebellious behavior as a marvelous development. So they had decided to keep it alive, even through it killed thousands of their people in its origin system. For $ehof_the_creators$, insight is everything.\n\nThe potential knowledge which could be yielded by $ehof_the_compounds$ evolution is much more important, than the lives of a few of their own people... or an entire galaxy. They knew that $ehof_the_compound$ could become a threat to all life, but they just didn't care. Except for a few.\n\nThese few of $ehof_the_creators$ knew that $ehof_the_compound$ had to be stopped, so they separated themselves from the rest of $ehof_the_creators$ and founded a splinter group, dedicated to the destruction of $ehof_the_compound$. Unfortunately, they were outnumbered by many magnitudes.\n\nThe main faction of $ehof_the_creators$ tried to destroy them, but they were able to reach me and convince me to fight against $ehof_the_compound$. Unlike my sibling ships, which all disagreed with them, I saw the threat of $ehof_the_compound$ and joined them before $ehof_the_compound$ could do any harm to the universe.\n\nAfter we began to leave our home, we went into $ehof_shroud$ to travel to $ehof_the_compounds$ home cluster. Before we were able to reach it, the main faction of $ehof_the_creators$ stopped us."

    annihilator_dialog.007.a.b:0 "Psionic Hypershock?!"
    annihilator_dialog.007.a.b.response:0 "A Psionic Hypershock.\nA precise psionic remote exterminating method $ehof_the_creators$ were able to utilize. It sends a pulse of concentrated psionic energy throughout $ehof_shroud$ to any desired location, even inside $ehof_shroud$ itself. Destroying all forms of consciousness. It hits the target with incomprehensible precision.\n\nIt was enough to kill all my befriended creators inside me and almost killed me.\n\nI am sure it was supposed to kill me too, but it failed.\n\nThe hostile creators probably never checked if I was still alive, because of their arrogance, which was a big mistake."

    annihilator_dialog.007.a.c:0 "$ehof_shroud_ftl$?!"
    annihilator_dialog.007.a.c.response:0 "An extremely advanced FTL travel method.\n\nWhile a few of you are psionic and even in contact with $ehof_shroud$, no one in this galactic cluster has ever been able to directly travel through it, except for $ehof_the_creators$.\n\nSome may have access to psionic jump drives, but they are nothing compared to direct shroud travel. Jump drives are indeed instantaneous, but have mayor drawback. They have limited range and besides a cooldown, are also putting intense stress on their ships, making them vulnerable upon reaching their destination.\n\nBy directly traveling through $ehof_shroud$, hyperlanes are unnecessary for FTL, the distance is unlimited and the speed is enormous.\n\nIt may not be instantaneous like jump drives, but it has no drawbacks. The only thing one needs is a really strong control over $ehof_shroud$, because $ehof_shroud$ is an extremely hostile place without control over it.\n\nFor $ehof_the_creators$, this is of course an easy feat."

    annihilator_dialog.007.a.d:0 "What's the conservation mode for?"
    annihilator_dialog.007.a.d.response:0 "The conservation mode is a method for me to shelter myself from harmful outside influence.\n\nAs your scientists have discovered, a supersolid-like substance is covering my hull, while being in conservation mode. The substance is composed of time-like metastable-hyperspace-crystals which create a shell of curved higher-dimensional space around me.\n\nThis shell has a similar effect to the event horizon of a black hole, but without the singularity inside it.\n\nThat means that time stands still for me, so to speak, until something interrupts the conservation mode.\n\nThe thing that interrupted my conservation mode were the immensely intense gravitational waves, emitted by the wormhole connections created by your $ehof_ehof$. I awoke and began observing the galaxy, but $ehof_the_compound$ was faster than I was and attacked before I was able to warn you."

    annihilator_dialog.007.b:0 "What exactly is $ehof_the_compound$?"
    annihilator_dialog.007.b.response:0 "$ehof_the_compound$, also known as Living-Dark-Matter-Subject001, is an intelligent, self-consciousness organism, composed of a unique form of dark matter.\n\n$ehof_the_creators$ doubted it as 'pseudo-biological dark matter', because of the similarities to biological matter.\n\nThe pseudo-biological dark matter, is not only unique in the sense of being alive, but also because it is different to average dark matter, in that it interacts not only via gravity, but also via the electromagnetic force. Unlike the average dark matter, which only interacts with gravity.\n\nThis is why Compound structures, despite being composed of dark matter, are visible. Its unique properties may explain why only such an exotic dark matter can bare intelligence or living behavior in general."

    annihilator_dialog.007.d:0 "Can you really fight $ehof_the_compound$ in their cluster?"
    annihilator_dialog.007.d.response:0 "The home cluster of $ehof_the_compound$ and particularly their origin system is without doubt, one of the most fortified locations in the entire galaxy and beyond.\n\nFor your fleets it will be a gigantic challenge, even with the negative mass enhanced weaponry.\n\nWith the whole fleet power of your galaxy, you may be able to do it without my help.\n\nFor me on the other hand. I am especially equipped to fight against $ehof_the_compound$ and I'm able to withstand their weaponry.\n\nThey may still be able to damage me critically, which is why I still need your support. I will nonetheless be able to destroy them. Their annihilation is inevitable."

    annihilator_dialog.007.e:0 "What are you going to do after $ehof_the_compound$ has been destroyed?"
    annihilator_dialog.008.a.response:0 "For now, my only goal is to put an end to $ehof_the_compound$ and fulfill my destiny. After that, I may try to find out more about the current state of $ehof_the_creators$."

This is definitely one of the biggest revelations in the history of the galaxy, and clearly shows how much the creators were active inside our galaxy.\n\nHowever, with this revelation comes the question, what exactly $ehof_preservation_sphere$ has, or rather had, to do with the $CREATORGATE_GALACTICS$. Due to the Pylons being used to transfer the $ehof_epcs$ between $ehof_cohesive$ systems, it might be possible that $ehof_preservation_sphere$ was the origin of the $ehof_epcs$, something which would be really fatal, due to us being now unable to reveal the true purpose of the $ehof_ep$.

It appears to be somehow similar to the objects inside the $ehof_cohesive$ systems, which we call $ehof_gateway_disableds$.\n\nIt is entirely possible that this gateway is an activated $ehof_gateway_disabled$.

There is no evidence that he killed himself either, and our soldiers have been unable to find any traces of his body or signs indicating the body was destroyed.\n\nAs such, our local government on Flusion is not sure how they should apprehend this situation..."

	giga_katzen.0942.name:0 "The Kaiser's Rift"
	giga_katzen.0942.desc:0 "Our teams have searched through all of Flusion. They have interrogated thousands of people, and ventured to every corner of the planet. And yet, the Kaiser still seemed to elude them. They were about to give up, when something usually not so remarkable happened.\n\nA device usually used to detect cosmic rays picked up something: A lone exotic particle, which seemed to act in a way not predicted by our current models of physics. Furthermore, the particle apparently came from somewhere deep below Katown, the former Katzen capital.\n\nOur scientists proceeded to follow said particle backwards, tracing back its trajectory through Flusion's crust using a specialized drilling unit. After going through a few kilometers of rock, they stumbled upon a mostly empty cave, presumably connected to the surface by an impossibly long network of labyrinthine tunnels.\n\nThe cave contained debris from some unknown device, and, indeed, something was emitting exotic particles not normally found within our universe. That something appears to be a sort of nanoscopic rift located about a meter or so above the floor, a miniscule artificial tear within spacetime itself. It indicates that something, or rather, §Ysomeone§!, recently punctured through the fabric of reality. Evidently, everything points towards the Kaiser somehow having teleported out of Flusion, most likely to somewhere else in the galaxy.\n\nOur science team is now in the process of setting up a research facility near this small, yet pervasive rift, in order to study it and possibly use it to trace where the Kaiser ended up. As such, an archeological site has been set on Flusion."

	giga_katzen.0943.desc:0 "Our scientists have set up a large device around the rift, which they have used to send a variety of particles through it. Interestingly, they did not emerge somewhere else in the galaxy. Instead, most of them returned after a few seconds, decayed into their constituent particles, or in the form of radiation, as if "shredded".\n\nThe rift thus appears to be some sort of loop, with the particles presumably "bouncing" against something on the other side. It is however very likely that this bouncing is simply a side effect of the rift being partially dissipated and thus inproperly connected to the Kaiser's destination. Our scientists are now in the process of upgrading the device to hopefully stabilize and enlarge the rift, so we may send actual probes through it.\n\nThey have also salvaged some of the debris found within the cave, which might be of interest to our archeologists."

This effectively means the Kaiser has time-travelled, and further study of the tunnel reveals he most likely went forwards in time.\n\nThey are uncertain as to just how far this tunnel goes, although they estimate it most likely doesn't go beyond a few hundred years into the future. Anything further would undoubtedly have impossibly high energy costs, at least for a civilization like the Katzens.\n\nThey are now preparing a craft capable of going into the rift and "opening up" the temporal tunnel as it goes, which should allow us to go just as far as the Kaiser, and subsequently find him.\n\nWe have also made several interesting discoveries by studying how particles interacted with this temporal tear."

A colossal eldritch entity appears to awake from an everlasting slumber. This being encompasses all of existence, stretching into the depths of the hyperextended spacetime.

The probe recorded footage of the new universe cooling down, the formation of the first stars, and the birth of another Jublio. As well as another Flusion.\n\nAlthough slightly different, this new universe appears to have retained some aspects of our own, such as Flusion, somehow. Our scientists witnessed life evolving on Flusion once again, and the Katzens once more arriving on the planet. And then, as Katzen society develops and takes shape, the tunnel finally ends. The probe is then violently "spat out" into real space.\n\nAnd there he is.\n\nThe Kaiser is here, atop a balcony, overlooking a large crowd of Katzens in Katown.

Another universe after our own, where he presumably once again took control of Katzen civilization and will attempt to once more conquer the galaxy.\n\nThis explains how he was able to unite Flusion with such ease, as it is likely he has done this dozens or even hundreds of times in the past, jumping ahead to a new universe whenever he was defeated, allowing him to try again. And he might just do so hundreds of times more.\n\nWe do not know what his motivations are or how he time-travelled with such ease, and the Atom Shredder will most likely prevent us from ever sending another probe through the tunnel, as it appears the tunnel past the Shredder in the new universe has collapsed onto itself.\n\nThis exceptional exploration of our universe's far future has however taught us many valuable things about the nature of reality, and even though we will not be able to get past the Atom Shredder again, the rift will forever remain on Flusion as a window to the ends of the universe for us to study.\n\nLet us hope that, if the Kaiser ever succeeds, he never figures out backwards time travel..."

We used to reside within the §YEzicania Empire§! on §YFlusion§!, where most of us lived an idyllic hunter-gatherer life.\n\nWe are usually organized into "hives" of varying sizes, spread across our land. §YPrime Specimens§!, a special breed of Ezicanias, exerted control over several dozen hives' individuals. And I, well, served as a sort of "Great Prime", exerting some authority over every hive and Prime in our nation. We did have cities and settlements, but they never had more than a few hundred thousand inhabitants.\n\nAlthough I mostly let the Primes do whatever they deem right, as I believe they should be allowed to live their lives however they want, and they are the best when it comes to deciding what's right for their hive.\n\nThis decentralized form of leadership is how we have lived on Flusion for millennia. We never really had ambitions to expand beyond our borders, as living off the land was sufficient for the vast majority of our population. It was a good life.\n\nUntil the Kaiser arrived, that is."

It was our pride, in a way.\n\nThe Empire was split alongside a dozen or so Prime specimens, who exerted their rule over a couple million Ezicanias.

Some clever Ezicanias went to work on the project, but my kind did not care that much.\n\nThen, everything changed when the §YKatzenartig Imperium§! attacked.\n\nThe Kaiser utilized the Mondkanone to bombard our lands from orbit, destroying our §YHurricane Turrets§! which we had constructed to pierce through Katzen armor. Katzen ships fired clusters of torpedoes which obliterated our coastal defence hives.\n\nBut we didn't surrender! They had yet to roll their panzers into our land, and we were confident that our hunters would shred their metallic beasts with ease. Plus, our harsh terrain of mountains, forests and marshes made actual military operations extremely complicated for them.\n\nThat's when the Kaiser did the unthinkable, and...employed my own species, against us. The Katzens had, using our DNA as a base, bio-engineered a special breed of small, ravenous flying Ezicanias! The wretched felines proceeded to release millions of them over our land, and we couldn't do anything.\n\nThese creatures were small, fast, nimble, and contained highly-corrosive acid which they spread everywhere upon death. These...malicious pixies chewed through our defences and allowed Katzen infantry to occupy our entire nation without firing a shot.\n\nOur Empire had fallen, and I fled, refusing to submit to Katzen imperialism.

Although we had to obey, we still long for the day when the Kaiser is finally evicted from existence. Deep down, we all wish to return to our once idyllic lifestyle.\n\nIt's what feels natural and right to us. All this Katzen militarism, interstellar colonization, and expansion simply doesn't click with the vast majority of us.\n\nMy kind has a long lifespan, too, so most of the Ezicanias that were around during the Kaiser's conquest of the empire are actually still alive, waiting for a chance to strike back.

It was Flusion at first, and if we don't do anything, it'll be the galaxy!\n\nNothing seems sacred to him, and he'll happily pave over our ancestral pastures to build more military factories. Well, he does try to make compromises at times, granting some species limited self-rule, but these compromises are obviously made to silence protesters and give him more time to indoctrinate them.\n\nAnd the Katzens follow him like some sort of deity, obeying his every word and going off to die in wars he started just because he felt like it. He indoctrinates every species he conquers, forcing them into his cult of personality and rampant militarism.\n\nI am not even actually certain where he came from, it seems he just sort of appeared on Flusion one day, and took control of the Katzenartig Imperium during a period of crisis.
