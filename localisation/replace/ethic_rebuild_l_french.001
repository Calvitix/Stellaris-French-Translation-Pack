 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DRONE_COA:0 "For long ages our people have been suffering from tyranny and oppression. In order to restore justice we - the working class - rose and established a planetary government with the labor unions as its core. From now on the state is going to care about the people, providing a decent income and quality of life for everyone. United as one we can reach an unprecedented height."

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_SOC_DEM:0 "Our civilization made it through devastating wars, isolated nations and alienated minds. But the moment has come when we realized that conflicts do not make any sense and it is time to unite in peace. We created a world government which is focused solely on the people and their common good. Democratic elections, social security and justice for everyone - all these allowed us to break the vicious cycle. And now we are ready to reach for the stars!"

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CAP_AUTOCRACY:0 "Trying different economic models we found that the key to well-being is personal initiative. But after uncontrolled free market economics had almost destroyed our civilization, government had to take financial flows under strict supervision. Now most of our wealth belongs to state corporations, with business regulated by a massive bureaucratic system. The careful selection of the ruler guarantees the sustainability of the whole system."

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CASTE:0 "Throughout history many ridiculous and bizarre forms of government have succeeded each other. In order to preserve social harmony we created this society, where everyone is a master of somebody beneath and a slave of somebody above. In the end every cog has their place, and the perfect government dominates the whole planet."

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_COMMUNISM:0 "For a long time our planet was divided among different nations, and its resources plundered by greedy capitalists. Until a wise leader arrived to unify us, caring about every last citizen. He created and himself headed the administration to run the whole planet. Switching to a planned economy allowed for the rapid increase of production rates, as well as the prosperity of the working class. All excess resources were directed to fulfill our long standing dream of reaching the stars."

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_COMMUNIST_DICTATORSHIP:0 "I exist. I am the the Mind. My body is made of sub-ordinate organisms, which forms the basis of our species. I began to rule all these weak creatures and we managed to conquer the whole planet. I gave some of them incredible intellectual qualities to help me with research, construction and war. But they do not have their own will. I am their will. Their Lower ones obeys the Higher ones, and the Higher ones are nothing but a slaves to me. I am the backbone and the heart. The only alternative to me is death. I will lead our species to the destiny, as I am the Hive and the Hive is me."

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_SOCIAL_DEMOCRACY:0 "Many ages of internecine wars showed us nothing but their meaninglessness. As soon as the very last war ended our economies started to boom. The quantity of trading goods increased together with their quality. Eventually this led to society valuing material possessions and wealth above everything else. The resulting high quality of life was a key factor in the unification of the whole planet."
