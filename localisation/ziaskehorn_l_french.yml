 r_ziaskehorn_fire: "Ziaskehorn Flame"
 r_ziaskehorn_fire_desc: "Excerpt, Prophecies of Zia (Pehizidii Tablet of Origins, 1st Edition, Unpublished):\n\nZiaskehorn Flame (Section 12)\nGiving kindling to the Flame and letting the Fires of Ziaskehorn burn uncontrollably would wipe out all life on the planet and plunge it into a tectonically unstable death as lava pours out of the oceans and fire rains from the skies. The Flame can, however, be controlled and mastered by an individual, unless that individual (FRAGMENT DESTROYED), granting unimaginable power. Afterward, however, the (FRAGMENT DESTROYED)."
 ziaskehorn_relic_active: "Burning fires of Ziaskehorn"
 ziaskehorn.01.name: "Igniting the Flame"
 ziaskehorn.01.desc: "As the Flame clung to its newly found kindling, it quickly spread into the Fires of Ziaskehorn. Almost immediately, our generals felt the heat of the newly living Fires spreading through their bodies. The aftermath is an array of unimaginably powerful armies, enhanced by the Fires of Ziaskehorn, able to use its power in their combats."
 ziaskehorn.02.name: "Too Much To Handle"
 ziaskehorn.02.desc: "As the power bestowed by the Ziaskehorn Flame left our armies, it left with more than it came with. All of our generals have perished, consumed by the Fires of Ziaskehorn. All that is left is simply their ashes, strewn about by the vivacity of the power that they once yielded."
 ziaskehorn.02.tooltip: "All of our generals perish."
 ziaskehorn_digsite: "The Fires of Ziaskehorn"
 ziaskehorn_digsite_desc: "The surface of [From.Planet.GetName] was once inhabited, but today it is nothing more than an inhospitable, volcanic rock. The pre-FTL civilization that once lived on the planet was advanced enough to create and send a few satellites around their home.\n\nThere is, however, no sign of them. All that remains are large cities slowly melting away. Perhaps there is something to be learned from these past occupants?"
 ziaskehorn.99.name: "Life Under Lava"
 ziaskehorn.99.desc: "Preliminary surveys of [FROMFROM.Planet.GetName] uncovered significant evidence that the planet was once inhabited. Large urban centers rest torn apart and overran by flowing lava, significantly damaged and slowly melting. Evidence of atomic-level technology was also found, indicating a fairly advanced pre-FTL civilization. Our scientific community urges us that the history of this ancient species be dug up, as basic surface scans reveal little."
 ziaskehorn.11.name: "A Fiery End"
 ziaskehorn.11.desc: "Preliminary investigations down on [From.Planet.GetName] indicate that the current volcanic state of the planet is due to a cataclysmic event that occurred some 311,000 years ago. The archeological team was able to decipher the language and communications technology used by the inhabitants.\n\nThe last communications throughout the planet revolve around a single word: Ziaskehorn.\n\nAt this point, it is still unclear why this event occurred. It is also ever-more intriguing that some of the communications decoded by Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName]'s team talk of Ziaskehorn before its occurrence, leading to the theory that this event may have been a long time coming."
 ziaskehorn.11.a: "See what else you can find."
 ziaskehorn.12.name: "War Never Changes"
 ziaskehorn.12.desc: "Delving deeper into the scorched remains of [From.Planet.GetName], the dig team has recovered fragments of the recent history of the inhabitants of the planet, now known as the Phezidii. For the better part of one-hundred years, four Phezidiian countries were locked in a state of indiscriminate total war among each other.\n\nIn response to the technological progression into the Atomic Age of one of the countries, the Aztiel Commonwealth, their main rival, the Nipa, sought something of equal power to maintain their fighting chance in the century-long conflict. Apparently the Nipa found their new weapon in ancient Phezidiian religious texts. The Fires of Ziaskehorn.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] theorizes that the Nippa may have unleashed an ancient weapon hidden in the roots of [From.Planet.GetName]."
 ziaskehorn.12.a: "Keep digging!"
 ziaskehorn.13.name: "Ancient Gods"
 ziaskehorn.13.desc: "Having been able to uncover some of the ancient texts hidden away in the remnants of [From.Planet.GetName] describing the Fires of Ziaskehorn, we have found new information on the entire scenario.\n\nThe Fires of Ziaskehorn are a two-thousand year old prophecy depicting the end of the world, first seen in early Phezidiian writing and religion. The Fires would ignite after an individual had received the Ziaskehorn Flame (or ember, there was much debate back then) from the ancient Phezidiian goddess of fire, Zia. Apparently Zia would have given the flame to an individual in the hopes of ending a great conflict, which early Phezidiian monks knew not of.\n\nKeeping with the prophecy, that individual had, since the moment they were born, always been destined to receive the Flame from Zia and unleash Ziaskehorn."
 ziaskehorn.13.a: "Disconcerting."
 ziaskehorn.14.name: "The Ziaskehorn Flame"
 ziaskehorn.14.desc: "As Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has suspected, the Nippa, in the hopes of winning the ever-lasting battle against the Aztiel Commonwealth searched for the Fires of Ziaskehorn and came across the prophesied event during which the goddess Zia gave the Ziaskehorn Flame away in order to end the war.\n\nUnable to control the power unleashed by the ignition of the Fires of Ziaskehorn, the Fires quickly consumed the entire planet, killing all inhabitants and rendering its surface completely volcanic. The prophecy was concluded. Ziaskehorn had unfolded across the planet.\n\nAlthough many questions are left unanswered; such as whether or not there may one day be life on the surface of [From.Planet.GetName], or who the supposed gods were (as the last traces of Phezidii society had completely abandoned religion during the incessant conflict), one of the questions that was answered was if anything was left of the Ziaskehorn Flame.\n\nOur [Root.Owner.GetArchaeologistPlural] working at a digsite near a large crater on the surface of [From.Planet.GetName] say that they were able to recover what appears to be a supernatural orb. The Ziaskehorn Flame."
 ziaskehorn.14.a: "Fascinating."
 ziaskehorn.21.name: "Curse of the Ziaskehorn Flame"
 ziaskehorn.21.desc: "While excavating the ruins on [From.Planet.GetName], Science Officer §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! felt a chilling sensation throughout their entire body. Albeit odd on a planet as blazing as [From.Planet.GetName], Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] assures us that they are fine. The rest of the digsite team, however, disagrees. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is nothing more than the frail outershell of the great leader they once were, slowly withering away."
 ziaskehorn.22.name: "Volcanic Eruption"
 ziaskehorn.22.desc: "Many [Root.Owner.GetArchaeologistPlural] were recently killed when a volcano erupted near the digsite on [From.Planet.GetName]. §H[Root.GetLeaderName]§! emerged unscathed from the aftermath, but work at the site has been momentarily halted as the expedition teams attempt to re-establish order and cleanup the remaining debris."
 ziaskehorn.23.name: "Hot Room"
 ziaskehorn.23.desc: "Our [Root.Owner.GetArchaeologistPlural] working on [From.Planet.GetName] have stumbled into a building with thick, hot fog densly clouding every room within it. It's unclear whether or not this is due to the planet's volcanic surface or past events. Nevertheless, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] assures us this will help the team with uncovering the past secrets of [From.Planet.GetName]." 
 Ziaskehorn.24.name: "Magma Overflow"
 ziaskehorn.24.desc: "Our archaeological expedition on [From.Planet.GetName] has encountered significant difficulties while attempting to dig through some of the urban area taken over by the burning surface of the planet. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that they require some resources and equipment in order to remove a severe overflow of underground magma and continue with the exploration or risk momentarily halting all work at the digsite."
