The aliens apparently learned that their sun was dying, and that it would soon explode and collapse into a [From.Planet.System.GetClassName], destroying all life in their system.

Some four million managed to get underground and enter the subterranean cities, but the project was not yet complete and large portions of the underground remained uninhabitable.\n\nWhen [From.Planet.System.GetName] exploded in a supernova some twenty years after that, the blast proved more severe than the aliens had planned for.

They stole our food, burned our villages, killed anyone who tried to fight back. They were eventually stopped by the rest of their kin, with whatever help we [shamrock_species.GetNamePlural] could offer.
