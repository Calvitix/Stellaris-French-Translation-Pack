We could retrieve them, or activate their self-destruct routines, or leave them on [From.GetName] in case we can still make use of them in the future.\n\nHowever, at this stage of their development, the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] would be very difficult to manipulate with the devices in any useful way."

However, the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have gone to considerable lengths to fight with honour and to keep civilians out of the conflict. The fact they are using diplomacy alongside battle suggests iron wills that will not resort to barbarism or pure uninhibited hatred.\n\nThis has also given them the spare [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName]-power and time to advance their military technologies. Their weapons and armour are now mass-produced by specialists and are mostly of good quality. Siege weapons are becoming more complex. Ships are getting sturdier with every construction project.\n\nThey even have medical specialists treating the wounded and improving their bio-sciences.\n\nIt looks like war is making most nations excel in the very art of making it."
